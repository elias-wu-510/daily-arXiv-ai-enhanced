*Shahrzad Sayyafzadeh,Hongmei Chi,Shonda Bernadin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end pipeline for generating, refining, and evaluating adversarial patches to compromise facial biometric systems using FGSM, diffusion models, and ViT-GPT2 for forensic analysis and security testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive framework for testing vulnerabilities in facial biometric systems through adversarial attacks, supporting forensic analysis and security evaluation of identity verification systems.

Method: Uses FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting identity classifiers, then employs diffusion models with reverse diffusion, Gaussian smoothing, and adaptive brightness correction to refine patches for imperceptibility. Applies patches to facial images and uses ViT-GPT2 for semantic captioning. Evaluates with perceptual hashing and segmentation for detection.

Result: Achieves high imperceptibility with SSIM of 0.95 while effectively evading facial recognition systems. The pipeline successfully generates adversarial patches that maintain natural visual characteristics while compromising biometric security.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end pipeline provides an effective framework for generating and evaluating adversarial patches against facial biometric systems, demonstrating vulnerabilities in identity verification while offering tools for forensic analysis and security testing.

Abstract: This work presents an end-to-end pipeline for generating, refining, and evaluating adversarial patches to compromise facial biometric systems, with applications in forensic analysis and security testing. We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions. We further demonstrate effective detection and analysis of adversarial patches and adversarial samples using perceptual hashing and segmentation, achieving an SSIM of 0.95.

*Carlo Sgaravatti,Riccardo Pieroni,Matteo Corno,Sergio M. Savaresi,Luca Magri,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCF3D is a sensor fusion framework for 3D object detection that combines 2D RGB image detection with 3D LiDAR detection through late fusion and cascade fusion to improve accuracy and domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving, but effectively combining RGB camera and LiDAR sensor data remains challenging. The paper aims to address inaccuracies in LiDAR-based detection and improve performance for challenging object categories.

Method: LCF3D combines two fusion principles: (1) Late fusion - matches LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections to filter out unmatched LiDAR false positives; (2) Cascade fusion - generates new 3D frustum proposals from unmatched RGB detections to recover missed objects from LiDAR.

Result: LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in KITTI dataset, and motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes. It also shows benefits for domain generalization across different sensor configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed LCF3D framework effectively combines multimodal sensor data through complementary fusion strategies, improving 3D object detection accuracy and demonstrating strong domain generalization capabilities for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

### [4] [NanoSD: Edge Efficient Foundation Model for Real Time Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09823)
*Subhajit Sanyal,Srinivas Soumitri Miriyala,Akshay Janardan Bankar,Sravanth Kodavanti,Harshit,Abhishek Ameta,Shreyas Pandith,Amit Satish Unde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoSD is a family of lightweight diffusion models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 for real-time image restoration on edge devices, achieving 20ms inference on mobile NPUs with 130M-315M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors for image restoration but are too computationally heavy for edge devices. Existing lightweight variants compress only parts of the pipeline, disrupting the latent manifold and limiting generalization to single tasks.

Method: Full-pipeline co-design using network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling applied jointly to both the U-Net and VAE encoder-decoder. This preserves the generative prior while creating Pareto-optimal models across accuracy-latency-size tradeoffs.

Result: Achieves real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile NPUs with 130M-315M parameters. Outperforms prior lightweight diffusion models in perceptual quality and deployability across multiple tasks: super-resolution, deblurring, face restoration, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices, demonstrating that parameter reduction alone doesn't guarantee hardware efficiency - architectural balance and latent-space preservation are crucial.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

### [5] [UniHash: Unifying Pointwise and Pairwise Hashing Paradigms for Seen and Unseen Category Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09828)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Hanwen Liu,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHash is a dual-branch hashing framework that unifies pointwise and pairwise training paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across both seen and unseen image categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hashing methods are limited to either pointwise or pairwise training paradigms, where pointwise excels on seen categories but pairwise generalizes better to unseen ones. There's a need for a unified approach that balances performance across both seen and unseen categories.

Method: Proposes Unified Hashing (UniHash) with two complementary branches: center-based (pointwise) and pairwise branches. Introduces bidirectional knowledge transfer via mutual learning loss and Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch hash representation exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios. Theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: UniHash successfully unifies pointwise and pairwise paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across both seen and unseen categories, addressing a key limitation in existing deep hashing methods.

Abstract: Effective retrieval across both seen and unseen categories is crucial for modern image retrieval systems. Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.

### [6] [ViSIL: Unified Evaluation of Information Loss in Multimodal Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09851)
*Po-han Li,Shenghui Chen,Ufuk Topcu,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ViSIL, an information-theoretic metric to quantify video information loss in multimodal summaries, enabling comparison across different summary formats and optimizing trade-offs between information coverage and processing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like BLEU/ROUGE fail to measure information coverage across different modalities (text vs keyframes) in multimodal video summaries. There's a need for a unified metric that can quantify what video information is lost in summaries across different formats.

Method: Develops Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score using vision-language model inference to measure information not captured by summaries. Uses information-theoretic framework to enable direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite structural differences.

Result: ViSIL scores show statistically significant correlation with human and VLM performance on Video QA tasks. Enables summary selection that outperforms text summaries by 7% in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load, establishing Pareto-optimal frontier for information loss vs processing speed trade-off.

Conclusion: ViSIL provides a unified, effective metric for evaluating multimodal video summaries that addresses limitations of traditional metrics, enabling better optimization of summary quality and efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

### [7] [Breaking the Limits of Open-Weight CLIP: An Optimization Framework for Self-supervised Fine-tuning of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09859)
*Anant Mehta,Xiyuan Wei,Xingyu Chen,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TuneCLIP is a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that improves open-weight CLIP models' performance across various downstream tasks without expensive retraining, overcoming the performance degradation typically seen with standard fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving CLIP performance usually requires expensive retraining from scratch on billions of samples. The authors want to enhance existing open-weight CLIP models using only self-supervised datasets to boost general performance across multiple tasks, not just adapt to a single downstream task.

Method: TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage that recovers optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias (inspired by theoretical analysis), and (2) a fine-tuning stage that optimizes a new contrastive loss to mitigate penalization on false negative pairs.

Result: TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. It elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark.

Conclusion: TuneCLIP sets a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation of CLIP models, demonstrating that self-supervised fine-tuning can effectively improve general performance across various tasks without expensive retraining.

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

*Kiarie Ndegwa,Andreas Gros,Tony Chang,David Diaz,Vincent A. Landau,Nathan E. Rutenbeck,Luke J. Zachmann,Guy Bayes,Scott Conway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VibrantSR is a generative super-resolution framework that estimates 0.5m canopy height models from 10m Sentinel-2 imagery, enabling seasonal-to-annual forest monitoring at continental scales without relying on costly aerial imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using aerial imagery are limited by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules. There's a need for consistent, operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales using globally available satellite data.

Method: VibrantSR uses generative super-resolution to upscale 10m Sentinel-2 seasonal composites to 0.5m canopy height models, leveraging globally available satellite imagery for consistent monitoring.

Result: Achieves MAE of 4.39m for canopy heights ≥2m across 22 eco-regions in western US, outperforming Meta (4.83m), LANDFIRE (5.96m), and ETH (7.05m) benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71m MAE) is more accurate, VibrantSR enables operational monitoring without costly aerial acquisitions.

Conclusion: VibrantSR provides a practical solution for continental-scale forest monitoring and carbon accounting using globally available Sentinel-2 data, overcoming limitations of aerial imagery while maintaining reasonable accuracy for operational applications.

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Savas Ozdemir,Ying Zhang,Yang Yang,Wei Shao,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVL-SAM2 is a unified 3D medical vision-language model that integrates report generation, visual question answering, and multi-paradigm segmentation (semantic, referring, interactive) in a single framework for 3D CT imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical VLMs excel at image-level text tasks but struggle with fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical imaging. There's a need for a unified framework that combines high-level semantic reasoning with precise 3D localization capabilities.

Method: Proposes MedVL-SAM2 with a cohesive architecture integrating image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception using SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module. Uses multi-stage training: first pre-trained on large-scale 3D CT image-text pairs for feature alignment, then jointly optimized with language-understanding and segmentation objectives using comprehensive 3D CT segmentation data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning with flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM, enabling comprehensive medical imaging analysis through a single, generalizable framework.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

### [10] [Transition Matching Distillation for Fast Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09881)
*Weili Nie,Julius Berner,Nanye Ma,Chao Liu,Saining Xie,Arash Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMD distills large video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators by matching multi-step denoising trajectories with lightweight conditional flow transitions, enabling real-time video generation with quality-speed trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large video diffusion models produce high-quality videos but are inefficient for real-time interactive applications due to their multi-step sampling process. There's a need to maintain visual quality while significantly improving generation speed.

Method: Transition Matching Distillation (TMD) decomposes diffusion backbones into: (1) main backbone for semantic representation extraction, and (2) flow head for conditional flow updates. It matches multi-step denoising trajectories with few-step probability transitions using distribution matching distillation with flow head rollout.

Result: TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in visual fidelity and prompt adherence when applied to Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models, providing flexible speed-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: TMD enables efficient distillation of large video diffusion models into few-step generators suitable for real-time applications while maintaining strong visual quality and prompt adherence.

Abstract: Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/tmd

*Zhihua Zhao,Guoqiang Li,Chen Min,Kangping Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-Drive: An Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion framework for robust traversable area segmentation in autonomous driving, achieving strong out-of-distribution generalization with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven approaches for traversable area segmentation suffer from degraded performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, which impairs downstream autonomous driving tasks. There's a need for methods that can generalize to unseen environmental conditions.

Method: Proposes OT-Drive with two key components: 1) Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) that decomposes scene information into joint distributions of weather, time-of-day, and road type to create semantic anchors, and 2) Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module that transports RGB and surface normal features onto the semantic anchor manifold.

Result: Achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios (outperforming prior methods by 6.35%) and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks (surpassing baselines by 13.99%). Demonstrates strong OOD generalization with limited training data.

Conclusion: OT-Drive substantially enhances practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment by enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios through optimal transport-based multi-modal fusion and semantic anchor construction.

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs lack spatial reasoning due to CLIP-style image encoders flattening 2D structure; using alternative encoders and 2D positional encodings improves spatial awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs built with CLIP-style image encoders flatten images into 1D patch sequences, discarding 2D structure essential for spatial reasoning. This spatial awareness gap is a blindspot and bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding like robotics and embodied AI.

Method: Investigate two architectural approaches: (1) image encoders trained with alternative objectives beyond contrastive pretraining, and (2) incorporation of 2D positional encodings to preserve spatial structure.

Result: Experiments show these architectural choices lead to improved spatial reasoning performance on several benchmarks compared to standard VLM designs.

Conclusion: Spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design, and addressing it through architectural modifications like alternative encoders and 2D positional encodings can enhance spatial reasoning capabilities for applications requiring spatial grounding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

### [13] [DR$^2$Seg: Decomposed Two-Stage Rollouts for Efficient Reasoning Segmentation in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09981)
*Yulin He,Wei Chen,Zhikang Jian,Tianhang Guo,Wenjuan Zhou,Minglong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DR²Seg: A self-rewarding framework that improves reasoning segmentation efficiency by decomposing the task into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation stages, reducing verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning segmentation methods suffer from "overthinking" - generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This reduces both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy.

Method: DR²Seg uses a two-stage rollout strategy: 1) Generate a self-contained description explicitly specifying the target object, 2) Use this description to replace the original complex query and verify self-containment. The framework introduces two self-rewards to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking without requiring extra supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models show that DR²Seg consistently improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

Conclusion: DR²Seg effectively addresses the overthinking problem in reasoning segmentation by decomposing the task and using self-rewards, leading to more efficient reasoning and better segmentation accuracy without additional supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

TL;DR: DW-DGAT: A dynamically weighted dual graph attention network for early diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases using multi-metric data fusion and class imbalance handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases is critical but challenging due to high-dimensional multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, heterogeneity of neuroimaging/phenotypic data, and class imbalance issues.

Method: Proposes DW-DGAT with: 1) general-purpose data fusion strategy for three structural forms of multi-metric data, 2) dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships for micro/macro-level features, 3) class weight generation mechanism with two stable loss functions to handle class imbalance.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets.

Conclusion: DW-DGAT effectively addresses key challenges in early neurodegenerative disease diagnosis through integrated data fusion, dual graph attention, and class imbalance handling, achieving superior performance on major clinical datasets.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

*Zefan Zhang,Kehua Zhu,Shijie Jiang,Hongyuan Lu,Shengkai Sun,Tian Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VERHallu benchmark evaluates VideoLLMs on event relation hallucinations (causal, temporal, subevent), revealing models struggle with dense-event reasoning and propose Key-Frame Propagating strategy to mitigate hallucinations without speed impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLM hallucination research focuses on objects/scenes but neglects event relation hallucinations. Need comprehensive evaluation of causal, temporal, and subevent relation hallucinations, especially in counterintuitive video scenarios.

Method: 1) Introduce VERHallu benchmark with three tasks: relation classification, QA, and counterfactual QA. 2) Analyze current VideoLLMs showing they rely on prior knowledge and overlook subevents. 3) Propose Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy to reallocate frame-level attention in intermediate layers for better multi-event understanding.

Result: State-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, insufficiently use frame-level cues, and overlook surrounding subevents. KFP strategy effectively mitigates event relation hallucinations without affecting inference speed.

Conclusion: Event relation hallucination is a critical but overlooked problem in VideoLLMs. VERHallu benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation, and the proposed KFP strategy offers an effective solution by enhancing frame-level attention allocation for better event relation understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

TL;DR: DiCo framework uses disentangled concept representation with slot-based anchors and concept blocks to bridge the modality gap between text and images for person re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIReID faces challenges due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, and the need to model fine-grained correspondences to distinguish individuals with similar attributes like clothing color, texture, or outfit style.

Method: Proposes DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation) framework with shared slot-based representation where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks to disentangle complementary attributes while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets, while enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

Conclusion: DiCo effectively addresses the modality gap in TIReID through hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment, providing both improved performance and better interpretability for fine-grained person retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

TL;DR: First synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow using physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences to address lack of realistic underwater event data with accurate ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging faces challenges from wavelength-dependent attenuation, scattering, turbidity, and non-uniform illumination, making ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. Event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range, but progress has been limited due to lack of datasets pairing realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow.

Method: Created synthetic underwater benchmark dataset using physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Applied modern video-to-event pipeline to rendered underwater videos to produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion.

Result: Produced first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow with dense ground truth. Benchmarked state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. Source code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While video models have shown Chain-of-Frame reasoning capabilities for various visual tasks, their potential for enhancing text-to-image generation remains unexplored due to lack of clear visual reasoning starting points and interpretable intermediate states in T2I generation.

Method: Proposes CoF-T2I model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps. Creates CoF-Evol-Instruct dataset of CoF trajectories modeling generation from semantics to aesthetics. Implements independent encoding for each frame to avoid motion artifacts.

Result: CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance: 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation through explicit Chain-of-Frame reasoning.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReaMIL is a multiple instance learning approach for histopathology that adds a selection head to MIL backbones to produce compact evidence sets without sacrificing performance, using a budgeted-sufficiency objective with sparsity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIL methods for whole-slide histopathology lack interpretability and produce evidence sets that are too large and scattered. There's a need for methods that can identify small, spatially compact evidence sets while maintaining classification performance.

Method: Adds a light selection head to MIL backbone that produces soft per-tile gates. Trained with budgeted-sufficiency objective: hinge loss enforcing true-class probability ≥ τ using only kept evidence, under sparsity budget on selected tiles.

Result: Matches or slightly improves baseline AUC across TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-BRCA, and PANDA datasets. On NSCLC: AUC 0.983 with mean minimal sufficient K ≈ 8.2 tiles at τ=0.90 and AUKC ≈ 0.864. Shows class confidence rises sharply with small tile sets.

Conclusion: ReaMIL provides interpretable, compact evidence sets without extra supervision, integrates with standard MIL training, and enables rigorous evaluation with metrics like MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for model behavior on WSIs.

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

### [20] [Thinking Like Van Gogh: Structure-Aware Style Transfer via Flow-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10075)
*Zhendong Wang,Lebin Zhou,Jingchuan Xiao,Rongduo Han,Nam Ling,Cihan Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D style transfer method that applies Post-Impressionist principles by using flow-guided geometric advection on 3D Gaussian Splatting to create expressive structural deformation aligned with artistic brushstrokes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods treat geometry as rigid substrate for surface texture, contrary to Post-Impressionist principles where geometric abstraction is the primary vehicle of expression. The authors aim to authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization by embracing geometric abstraction as the main expressive element.

Method: Flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space. This rectifies Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without mesh priors. Includes luminance-structure decoupling to isolate geometric deformation from color optimization.

Result: Enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints, creating authentic Post-Impressionist stylization in 3D scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully operationalizes Post-Impressionist principles in 3D style transfer by prioritizing geometric abstraction over surface-level texture, with a novel evaluation approach using VLM-as-a-Judge to assess artistic authenticity subjectively.

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on features from the original dataset but overlook task-specific information, creating a target gap between distillation objectives and downstream task performance. There's a need to incorporate characteristics that benefit downstream training into the distillation process.

Method: Proposes DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module that samples final distilled datasets from image pools generated by existing methods, following specific target difficulty distributions. Also introduces DAG (Difficulty-Aware Guidance) to explore difficulty's effect during the generation process.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing improved performance in dataset distillation for image classification tasks.

Conclusion: Difficulty-guided approaches successfully bridge the target gap in dataset distillation and highlight the broader potential of difficulty concepts for diverse downstream tasks beyond image classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal learning approaches rely heavily on expensive human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by enabling self-improvement using only unlabeled data.

Method: V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop with two roles: a Questioner that synthesizes challenging questions using dual-track reasoning rewards, and a Solver optimized via pseudo-labels from majority voting. Both are trained iteratively using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Without any human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric tasks by +2.6.

Conclusion: V-Zero demonstrates the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems, showing that models can enhance their reasoning capabilities using only unlabeled images without costly human annotations.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on pseudo-labeling or two-stage clustering without principled mechanisms to disentangle essential category-defining signals from instance-specific noise, limiting their effectiveness for real-world open-world applications.

Method: InfoSculpt reframes GCD from an information-theoretic perspective using the Information Bottleneck principle. It introduces dual Conditional Mutual Information objectives: Category-Level CMI on labeled data for compact discriminative representations of known classes, and Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the information-theoretic approach for disentangling categorical information from instance-specific noise.

Conclusion: The information-theoretic framework provides a principled mechanism for GCD by systematically sculpting representation space through dual CMI objectives, enabling robust disentanglement of category-level signals from instance-specific noise for improved open-world classification.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

Conclusion: FlowAct-R1 successfully addresses the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction, enabling practical interactive humanoid video generation with temporal consistency and low latency.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Conclusion: MathDoc establishes a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions and highlights the need for MLLMs to develop active refusal capabilities for incomplete/illegible inputs.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

### [26] [Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107)
*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-combination collaborative fusion framework for Visual In-Context Learning that generates three contextual representation branches from different prompt combinations, enabling more robust predictions than single-prompt approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current "retrieve-then-prompt" VICL approaches discard valuable contextual information by selecting only the single best visual prompt or collapsing multiple prompts into one representation, limiting reasoning capability. A more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is needed to unlock the full potential of diverse contexts.

Method: Proposes a framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion to multi-combination collaborative fusion. Generates three contextual representation branches, each integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary signals feed into a novel MULTI-VQGAN architecture designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse tasks (foreground segmentation, single-object detection, image colorization) demonstrate strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Conclusion: Multi-combination collaborative fusion better leverages diverse contextual information in VICL, overcoming limitations of single-prompt approaches and enabling more powerful visual reasoning across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Shifu Yan,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Vision In-Context Learning framework improves inpainting models by fusing multiple prompts and using arrangement-specific MLPs, achieving better performance on visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision In-Context Learning methods have two key limitations: (1) they only select the most similar prompt, discarding complementary cues from other high-quality prompts, and (2) they fail to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.

Method: The proposed end-to-end VICL framework includes: (1) an adaptive Fusion Module that aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts; (2) arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model; and (3) a bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism that swaps query and prompt roles to enhance collaboration between the fusion module and inpainting model.

Result: Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed VICL framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by better utilizing multiple prompts and their structural arrangements, leading to improved performance and generalization across different visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

*Sicheng Yang,Zhaohu Xing,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-Seg introduces vector quantization-based feature perturbation for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, replacing dropout with a controllable Quantized Perturbation Module and incorporating foundation model guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency learning methods in semi-supervised medical segmentation rely on dropout perturbation, which requires careful manual tuning of dropout rates - a sensitive hyperparameter that's difficult to optimize and often leads to suboptimal regularization.

Method: Proposes VQ-Seg with: 1) Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) using vector quantization to discretize feature space and shuffle spatial locations of codebook indices for controllable regularization; 2) Dual-branch architecture sharing post-quantization features for both reconstruction and segmentation; 3) Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate foundation model guidance for semantic information lost during quantization.

Result: Extensive experiments on a new large-scale Lung Cancer dataset (828 CT scans) and other public benchmarks show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: VQ-Seg successfully replaces dropout-based perturbation with a more controllable vector quantization approach, effectively addresses information loss through dual-branch architecture and foundation model guidance, and demonstrates superior performance on medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

*Linquan Wu,Tianxiang Jiang,Yifei Dong,Haoyu Yang,Fengji Zhang,Shichaang Meng,Ai Xuan,Linqi Song,Jacky Keung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaViT addresses the perception gap in multimodal reasoning by aligning latent visual thoughts between teacher and student models, improving visual grounding and outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning methods rely on external supervision and ignore intrinsic visual attention dynamics, leading to a perception gap where students mimic teacher outputs while attending to different visual regions, relying on language priors rather than grounded perception.

Method: LaViT aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings by compelling students to autoregressively reconstruct teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories before text generation, using curriculum sensory gating to prevent shortcut learning.

Result: LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding with up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks, enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Aligning latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings effectively bridges the perception gap in multimodal reasoning, leading to improved visual grounding and superior performance even with smaller models.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

*Chao Huang,Benfeng Wang,Wei Wang,Jie Wen,Li Shen,Wenqi Ren,Yong Xu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), a new task that elevates video anomaly analysis from simple description to structured multi-stage reasoning, and presents a large dataset with 8,641 videos and 50,000+ samples to support this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based methods for Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding are limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. There's a need to advance from descriptive understanding to structured reasoning.

Method: The authors define the VAR task requiring progressive reasoning over anomalous events. They create a large dataset with structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT) annotations, and propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization for enhanced reasoning under weak supervision. They develop Vad-R1-Plus, an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model supporting adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: The paper successfully elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured multi-stage reasoning through the VAR task definition, large annotated dataset, and novel methods that enhance reasoning reliability and decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

TL;DR: RAG-3DSG improves open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation by reducing aggregation noise through uncertainty estimation and using retrieval-augmented generation, while accelerating processing with dynamic downsample-mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation methods suffer from low object recognition accuracy and slow speed due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density in multi-view image processing.

Method: Proposes RAG-3DSG with two key innovations: 1) Re-shot guided uncertainty estimation to mitigate aggregation noise, 2) Object-level retrieval-augmented generation using reliable low-uncertainty objects, and 3) Dynamic downsample-mapping strategy for accelerated cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity.

Result: Experiments on Replica dataset show significant improvement in node captioning accuracy for 3D scene graph generation while reducing mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

Conclusion: RAG-3DSG effectively addresses accuracy and speed limitations in open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation through uncertainty-aware aggregation and efficient processing strategies.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPIR: A two-stage all-in-one image restoration framework that predicts task-aware inverse degradation operators with uncertainty guidance for efficient multi-task restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods add complexity through prompts or large models, hindering real-time applicability. Need for efficient approach that handles multiple restoration tasks adaptively without excessive computational overhead.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Predicts task-aware inverse degradation operator to produce initial restoration with uncertainty map highlighting difficult regions; 2) Refines restoration guided by uncertainty map. Uses same inverse operator prediction network in both stages with task-aware parameters. Accelerates convolution operations for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments validate OPIR's superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration. Achieves efficient restoration through tightly integrated architecture.

Conclusion: OPIR provides an efficient all-in-one image restoration solution by predicting task-aware inverse degradation operators with uncertainty guidance, achieving strong performance while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

*Kim Youwang,Lee Hyoseok,Subin Park,Gerard Pons-Moll,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELITE is an efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis system from monocular video that combines 3D and 2D priors for high-fidelity, animatable avatars with strong in-the-wild generalization, achieving 60x faster synthesis than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for monocular video avatar synthesis either use 3D data priors (which struggle with in-the-wild generalization) or 2D generative priors (which are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination). The authors identify complementary synergy between these two priors to overcome their individual limitations.

Method: 1. Feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) for fast Gaussian avatar initialization. 2. Test-time generative adaptation using both real and synthetic images as supervision. 3. Rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer (instead of full diffusion denoising) to restore missing visual details while being grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings.

Result: ELITE produces visually superior avatars compared to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than 2D generative prior methods. The system demonstrates strong in-the-wild generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: By synergistically combining 3D and 2D priors with efficient initialization and test-time adaptation, ELITE achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis from monocular video with excellent generalization and significantly improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

TL;DR: DepthDirector: A video re-rendering framework that enables precise camera trajectory control while preserving video content by using depth video from 3D representation as guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for camera control in video generation often fail to fully leverage 3D priors of video diffusion models and suffer from the "Inpainting Trap," leading to subject inconsistency and degraded quality when altering camera trajectories.

Method: Proposes DepthDirector with a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both source video and warped depth sequence under target viewpoint into pretrained video generation models. Uses lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter for training and constructs MultiCam-WarpData dataset with 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes.

Result: DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality, demonstrating faithful reproduction of dynamic scenes under novel camera trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the camera control challenge by leveraging geometric guidance signals to help video diffusion models comprehend camera movements while preserving their 3D understanding capabilities, enabling precise camera control with consistent content generation.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: Automatic slide region highlighting system that synchronizes speaker narration with relevant visual elements to reduce cognitive load during presentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the cognitive strain caused by the disconnect between spoken narration and visual slide content during presentations, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy talks where listeners struggle to identify relevant slide regions while following the speaker.

Method: Analyzes spoken content and matches it with textual or graphical elements in slides to automatically identify and highlight the most relevant slide regions, ensuring better synchronization between audio and visual content.

Result: Developed a system that explores different approaches to solving the slide-speaker synchronization problem, with assessment of success and failure cases, and made code and dataset publicly available.

Conclusion: Automatic slide region highlighting based on speaker narrative represents an important advancement for multimedia document analysis, reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension in educational videos and conference talks.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

Method: Developed a comprehensive pipeline for constructing high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset; collected 100M image-text pairs from Common Crawl with rigorous selection process; primarily uses 2024-2025 web data to capture evolving semantic trends.

Result: DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across Chinese downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations when compared with existing datasets through continual pre-training of SigLIP2 model.

Conclusion: DanQing addresses the Chinese VLP data gap with high-quality, recent web data, enabling better Chinese vision-language models; will be open-sourced under CC-BY 4.0 license to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, causing substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. There's a need for more efficient universal attacks.

Method: HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations at sample and optimization levels. For images: disentangles adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, uses ScMix augmentation to diversify visual contexts. For optimization: leverages temporal hierarchy of historical and future gradients. For text: identifies globally influential words using intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures.

Result: Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks over existing methods.

Conclusion: HRA provides an effective universal attack framework for VLP models that overcomes computational limitations of sample-specific attacks while maintaining strong attack performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

Conclusion: ROMA successfully addresses streaming audio-video understanding challenges by providing unified reactive and proactive interaction capabilities, with standardized evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery has intrinsic sparsity, and current DNN-based SAR-ATR systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks while over-relying on background regions. Existing attacks require visually perceptible distortions, creating a need for attacks that balance effectiveness and stealthiness.

Method: Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show SRAW significantly degrades state-of-the-art SAR-ATR model performance and consistently outperforms existing methods in imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Conclusion: SRAW provides an effective and stealthy adversarial attack method for SAR-ATR that addresses the limitations of existing approaches through spatial deformation with region-aware budget allocation.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2G paradigm enables LLM-based text encoders in diffusion models to reason about and rewrite user prompts before image generation, improving factual consistency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models use LLMs only as text encoders without leveraging their reasoning capabilities, leading to literal generation that lacks deeper understanding of what should be visually depicted from textual prompts.

Method: Proposes think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm where LLM-based text encoder reasons about and rewrites raw user prompts. Uses lightweight supervised fine-tuning to activate think-then-rewrite pattern, then co-optimizes LLM encoder and diffusion backbone via Dual-GRPO with image-grounded rewards.

Result: Substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score (nearly on par with GPT-4).

Conclusion: T2G represents a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities, moving beyond literal text-to-pixel mapping to more intelligent visual synthesis.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes supervised CNNs for inverse problems through the lens of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator with CNN inductive biases (translation equivariance and locality), deriving an interpretable LE-MMSE formula that matches neural network outputs in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of supervised CNNs in solving imaging inverse problems, they lack theoretical understanding and are treated as black boxes. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing trained neural networks through theoretical frameworks.

Method: Analyze CNNs through MMSE estimator with functional constraints capturing CNN inductive biases: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Derive an analytic, interpretable LE-MMSE formula under empirical training distribution.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments across inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP) show theory matches neural network outputs with PSNR ≥25dB. Provides insights into physics-aware vs physics-agnostic estimators, impact of high-density regions, and other factors.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges theoretical understanding with empirical CNN performance for inverse problems by deriving LE-MMSE formula that captures CNN inductive biases, providing interpretable insights into neural network behavior and performance factors.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

Conclusion: The proposed HPE-Bench and unified MLLM framework successfully address limitations in current pose editing evaluation by providing comprehensive assessment capabilities that combine authenticity detection with quality analysis.

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

TL;DR: DiffCR is a diffusion-based image compression framework that uses consistency prior refinement for efficient high-fidelity reconstruction, achieving significant bitrate savings and 10x speed-up over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image compression methods suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms, limiting their practical application despite enabling visually plausible compression at extremely low bit rates.

Method: Proposes DiffCR with two key components: 1) Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines ε-prediction prior from pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents using Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA), and 2) lightweight consistency estimator enabling fast two-step decoding by preserving semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling.

Result: Achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over 10× speed-up compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based compression baselines, without updating the backbone diffusion model.

Conclusion: DiffCR provides an efficient and high-fidelity image compression framework that overcomes the limitations of existing diffusion-based approaches, making diffusion priors more practical for real-world compression applications through significant speed improvements and bitrate savings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

*Dian Jiao,Jiaxin Duan,Shuai Zhao,Jiabing Leng,Yiran Zhang,Feng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIST2 is a novel Transformer that compresses text into visual tokens for both prefilling and inference, achieving 4x compression with 3x faster generation, 77% memory reduction, and 74% FLOPS reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models show promise for text compression but only work during prefilling, failing to save computational costs during token-by-token inference. The paper aims to achieve global context compression that works for both prefilling and inference stages.

Method: VIST2 interleaves text chunks with their visual encodings, using only visual tokens in pre-context to predict next text tokens. Text chunks are rendered into sketch images, trained with curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning.

Result: With 4x compression ratio, VIST2 models (0.6B to 8B) show significant superiority on long writing tasks: 3x speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS compared to baselines.

Conclusion: VIST2 successfully achieves global context compression that works for both prefilling and inference, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains for long writing tasks while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

TL;DR: A multimodal survival prediction framework for NSCLC that handles missing modalities using foundation models and missing-aware encoding, achieving best performance with WSI and clinical data fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical applicability of multimodal deep learning for NSCLC survival prediction is limited by small cohort sizes and missing modalities, which force complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation, reducing available data and potentially introducing bias.

Method: Proposes a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates CT scans, whole-slide histopathology images, and clinical variables using foundation models for feature extraction and missing-aware encoding strategy for intermediate multimodal fusion under incomplete modality profiles.

Result: Intermediate fusion outperforms unimodal baselines and early/late fusion strategies, with WSI and clinical fusion achieving best performance (73.30 C-index). The model adaptively down-weights less informative modalities like CT and is resilient to missing modalities without dropping patients.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective multimodal survival prediction in NSCLC while handling real-world missing data challenges, with adaptive modality weighting and foundation model integration providing robust clinical applicability.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lunar rendering pipelines use simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models that are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation.

Method: U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing/illumination geometry. Predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from lunar digital elevation models (DEMs) without multi-view imagery or reflectance-capture hardware.

Result: 38% reduction in photometric error compared to state-of-the-art baseline on geographically held-out Tycho crater region. Higher PSNR and SSIM scores, improved perceptual similarity, and captures fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models.

Conclusion: First method to infer spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry, enabling realistic lunar surface rendering without requiring multi-view imagery or specialized hardware at inference time.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models work well for physical entities (buildings, water) but struggle with socially-defined categories (schools, parks) in urban environments, which are crucial for downstream applications.

Method: Propose SocioReasoner framework using vision-language model reasoning with cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning, simulating human annotation process. Use reinforcement learning to optimize the non-differentiable reasoning process.

Result: Experiments show gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Introduce SocioSeg dataset with satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities in hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: Vision-language reasoning effectively addresses socio-semantic segmentation challenges, enabling identification of socially-defined urban entities with improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MERGETUNE introduces continued fine-tuning (CFT) to recover pretrained knowledge after zero-shot models have been adapted, using linear mode connectivity to merge zero-shot and fine-tuned solutions without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision-language models like CLIP often causes catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge, and existing methods can't fully prevent this forgetting during adaptation.

Method: Proposes MERGETUNE, a model-agnostic CFT strategy guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC). It continues fine-tuning trainable parameters to find a continued model with low-loss paths to both zero-shot and fine-tuned solutions, using a second-order surrogate to approximate LMC without data replay.

Result: Improves harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6% on base-novel generalization without adding parameters, achieves superior performance to CLIP on DTD and EuroSAT, and surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost.

Conclusion: MERGETUNE effectively recovers lost pretrained knowledge through continued fine-tuning, offering a practical post-hoc solution to catastrophic forgetting in vision-language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Conclusion: Satellite prior maps effectively address depth ambiguity and occlusion in HD map construction, providing significant performance improvements over traditional camera-only and camera-LiDAR approaches.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map.

Motivation: Automated creation of digital twins and asset inventories is crucial for smart cities and facility management, but current methods using cost-effective sparse imagery face challenges with robustness, localization accuracy, and fine-grained state understanding.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection fused with spatial-attention matching for robust cross-view association; 2) Geometry-guided refinement for precise decimeter-level 3D localization; 3) Vision-Language Model agent with multi-modal prompting for fine-grained operational state diagnosis.

Result: Experiments show SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors, offering scalable, cost-effective infrastructure digitization.

Conclusion: SVII-3D provides a unified framework that bridges the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance, enabling high-fidelity infrastructure digitization.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

TL;DR: Deep learning models (FFA-Net and AECR-Net) improve gauge image visibility in smoky/hazy environments for automated reading by first responders, using synthetic Unreal Engine dataset with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images in hazy/smoky environments have reduced visibility, hindering infrastructure monitoring and emergency services. Accurate gauge interpretation is crucial for first responders during critical situations.

Method: Used two deep learning architectures (FFA-Net and AECR-Net) to enhance gauge images corrupted with haze/smoke. Created synthetic dataset of 14,000+ images using Unreal Engine due to lack of benchmark datasets. Trained with 80/10/10 split for haze and smoke datasets.

Result: For synthetic haze dataset: SSIM ~0.98 and PSNR ~43dB, comparable to state-of-the-art. AECR-Net performed more robustly than FFA-Net. Smoke dataset results were poorer but still interesting, as smoke enhancement is more challenging due to inhomogeneity and high density.

Conclusion: Deep learning architectures can significantly improve analog gauge image quality in smoke/haze scenes. Enhanced images can be successfully post-processed for automatic gauge reading, demonstrating practical value for emergency response applications.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

TL;DR: A domain-adapted framework transforms Large Vision Language Models into specialized agents for urban infrastructure analysis by combining fine-tuning with knowledge-grounded reasoning to achieve accurate detection and attribute recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision models struggle with fine-grained urban infrastructure attributes and domain rules, while VLMs often misinterpret complex facility states according to engineering standards, leading to unreliable real-world performance.

Method: Proposes a domain-adapted framework with: 1) Open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO for robust asset localization with minimal supervision, 2) LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning, and 3) Dual-modality RAG module that retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: Achieves 58.9 mAP for detection and 95.5% accuracy for attribute recognition on a comprehensive urban roadside scene dataset, demonstrating robust performance for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms VLMs into specialized agents for urban infrastructure analysis by integrating data-efficient fine-tuning with knowledge-grounded reasoning, providing a robust solution that addresses domain-specific challenges and professional compliance requirements.

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: WMReward uses latent world models to improve physics plausibility in video generation through inference-time alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results in physics IQ benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models often violate basic physics principles, limiting their practical utility. While some attribute this to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, the authors identify that suboptimal inference strategies also contribute to this deficiency.

Method: Introduces WMReward, treating physics plausibility improvement as an inference-time alignment problem. Uses a latent world model (VJEPA-2) as a physics prior reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling of test-time compute for better generation performance.

Result: Substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, validated by human preference studies. Achieved 62.64% final score in ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, winning first place and outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 7.42%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, suggesting this approach extends beyond specific instantiations or parameterizations.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving benchmarks lack dense traffic scenarios needed to model complex interactions among road users, limiting the robustness of prediction and planning systems.

Method: Collaborated with industrial partner DeepScenario to create DeepUrban dataset using drone-captured high-resolution images at ~100m altitude over urban intersections, enriched with 3D traffic objects, maps, and scene information.

Result: Adding DeepUrban to nuScenes boosts vehicle prediction and planning accuracy by up to 44.1% on ADE and 44.3% on FDE metrics, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: DeepUrban addresses the scarcity of dense traffic scenarios in current benchmarks and significantly enhances trajectory prediction and planning performance for autonomous driving systems in complex urban environments.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

### [58] [Jordan-Segmentable Masks: A Topology-Aware definition for characterizing Binary Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10577)
*Serena Grazia De Benedictis,Amedeo Altavilla,Nicoletta Del Buono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topology-aware segmentation evaluation framework based on the Jordan Curve Theorem to assess structural coherence of segmentation masks, addressing limitations of conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation evaluation metrics (pixel-wise, region-based, boundary-focused) often fail to capture structural and topological coherence. Small inaccuracies can yield high scores while masks fail to preserve object shape or connectivity, especially problematic in medical imaging and object delineation where topological correctness is crucial.

Method: Proposes a topology-aware segmentation notion based on Jordan Curve Theorem adapted for digital planes. Defines "Jordan-segmentatable mask" - a binary segmentation ensuring topological separation into two connected components. Uses digital topology and homology theory to extract a 4-curve candidate from masks and verifies topological validity using Betti numbers (β₀ = β₁ = 1).

Result: Develops a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion for assessing structural coherence of segmentation masks. The framework identifies when a mask's complement splits into exactly two 8-connected components, indicating proper topological separation.

Conclusion: The approach combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, particularly for applications requiring topological correctness preservation.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

*Frank Mollard,Marcus Becker,Florian Roehrbein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: White-box attack on CV models using SHAP values to generate adversarial examples that reduce model confidence or cause misclassifications while remaining imperceptible to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks can compromise deep learning model performance by deceiving algorithms while eluding human perception. Need to develop more robust attacks that work even when gradients are hidden or obfuscated.

Method: Leverages SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to quantify importance of individual inputs to model outputs at inference stage. Uses these values to craft adversarial perturbations that target the most influential features.

Result: SHAP-based attacks are more robust than Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) in generating misclassifications, particularly in gradient hiding scenarios where traditional gradient-based attacks fail.

Conclusion: SHAP values provide an effective alternative to gradient-based methods for crafting adversarial attacks, offering greater robustness against gradient obfuscation defenses while maintaining imperceptibility to human observers.

Abstract: The paper introduces a white-box attack on computer vision models using SHAP values. It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets to advance machine intelligence in physical world understanding, as existing datasets are limited in scale and vocabulary coverage.

Conclusion: Action100M establishes a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling, enabling better physical action inference from visual observations.

Abstract: Inferring physical actions from visual observations is a fundamental capability for advancing machine intelligence in the physical world. Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains.

*Peng Chen,Xiaobao Wei,Yi Yang,Naiming Yao,Hui Chen,Feng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSATalker is a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based framework for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation that supports multi-turn conversations by encoding social relationships into the generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking head generation methods have limitations: mesh-based 3D methods lack realistic textures, 2D large-model methods are computationally expensive, and current 3DGS methods are speaker-only without considering social relationships. There's a need for efficient, realistic, and socially-aware multi-person conversation generation for VR social scenarios.

Method: The framework first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets for high-fidelity rendering. A socially-aware module encodes social relationships (blood/non-blood, equal/unequal) into embeddings using a learnable query mechanism. The method uses a three-stage training paradigm and a custom dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments show RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The framework successfully generates realistic talking heads while capturing interpersonal dynamics in multi-turn conversations.

Conclusion: RSATalker is the first framework to leverage 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with multi-turn conversation support, addressing key limitations of existing approaches and advancing VR social interaction capabilities.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Molmo2 is a new open-source video-language model family that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models and introduces novel point-driven grounding capabilities for images and videos, trained on newly collected open datasets without using proprietary VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source community lacks strong video-language models that don't rely on proprietary VLM data or distillation, and existing models (even proprietary ones) lack grounding capabilities like pointing and tracking in pixels that are crucial for many downstream applications.

Method: Created 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets collected without closed VLMs, developed an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, implemented bi-directional attention on vision tokens, and introduced a novel token-weight strategy.

Result: The 8B model outperforms other open-weight models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long videos. It significantly beats Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on tracking).

Conclusion: Molmo2 provides the open-source community with state-of-the-art video-language models that offer exceptional grounding capabilities without relying on proprietary data, establishing new foundations for advancing video and image understanding research.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human motions and 2D human videos are intrinsically coupled - 3D motions provide structural prior for plausibility and consistency, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization for motions. This necessitates coupling their generation processes.

Method: 1) Propose effective 2D human motion representation that inherits prior from pre-trained video diffusion models. 2) Design dual-branch diffusion model with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions to couple motion and video generation. 3) Create CoMoVi Dataset with text and motion annotations for diverse human motions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks. The framework generates 3D motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop.

Conclusion: CoMoVi successfully couples 3D human motion and video generation, leveraging the complementary strengths of both domains through a unified co-generative framework with mutual feature interaction.

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

TL;DR: CURVE is a new benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning that challenges current Video-LLMs with culturally diverse content and native language annotations, revealing significant performance gaps compared to human-level understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding benchmarks are biased toward western-centric data and English language, lacking cultural diversity and native language representation needed for truly global video reasoning evaluation.

Method: Created CURVE benchmark with human-generated annotations from diverse cultural videos across 18 global locales, featuring complex questions, answers, and reasoning steps in native languages. Also developed evidence-based graphs from reasoning traces and proposed iterative error analysis strategy.

Result: State-of-the-art Video-LLMs perform substantially below human-level accuracy on CURVE, with errors primarily stemming from visual perception of cultural elements rather than language understanding.

Conclusion: CURVE exposes significant limitations in current video models' ability to understand cultural context, highlighting the need for more culturally-aware video reasoning systems and providing a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

Conclusion: This work addresses invertebrate under-representation in trait databases and supports the development of AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, fostering advancements in biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Despite the ecological significance of invertebrates, global trait databases remain heavily biased toward vertebrates and plants, limiting comprehensive ecological analyses of high-diversity groups like ground beetles. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI. Validated against manual measurements, our digital trait extraction achieves sub-millimeter precision, ensuring reliability for ecological and computational studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPS improves autonomous driving OOD robustness by randomly masking patch features during training, forcing policies to learn invariant representations and avoid overfitting to redundant patch correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-aligned features from foundation models contain high redundancy due to self-attention mechanisms, leading policies to overfit spurious correlations and perform poorly on out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors each frame while preserving spatial layout, providing different stochastic but complete views of the same scene to the policy.

Result: SPS achieves 6.2% average improvement across OOD scenarios, up to 20.4% in closed-loop simulations, 2.4× faster training, and transfers to real-world cars without tuning.

Conclusion: Random patch masking during training creates invariant representations that improve OOD robustness, generalization, and efficiency in autonomous driving policies.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

TL;DR: CLI introduces a dynamic many-to-many bridge between vision and language models to overcome the visual feature bottleneck in current VLMs, enabling better hierarchical visual knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have a severe visual feature bottleneck due to crude, asymmetric connections that only link vision encoder output to LLM input, limiting comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge and compromising integration of local details with global semantics.

Method: Cross-Layer Injection (CLI) framework with two synergistic components: Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism allows LLM to selectively inject relevant visual information based on real-time decoding context.

Result: Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks show significant performance improvements when CLI is integrated into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm for deeper multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: CLI unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy through a lightweight, parameter-efficient framework that creates dynamic many-to-many connections between vision and language modalities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

### [68] [Alterbute: Editing Intrinsic Attributes of Objects in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10714)
*Tal Reiss,Daniel Winter,Matan Cohen,Alex Rav-Acha,Yael Pritch,Ariel Shamir,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alterbute is a diffusion-based method for editing object intrinsic attributes (color, texture, material, shape) while preserving identity and scene context, using Visual Named Entities for identity-preserving supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that fail to preserve object identity, or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. There's a need for a method that can edit intrinsic attributes while maintaining perceived identity and scene context.

Method: Uses diffusion-based approach with: (1) relaxed training objective allowing changes to both intrinsic/extrinsic attributes conditioned on identity reference image, textual prompt for target attributes, and background/mask; (2) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained identity categories automatically extracted using vision-language model from large dataset for scalable identity-preserving supervision. At inference, restricts extrinsic changes by reusing original background and mask.

Result: Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing, demonstrating effective editing of color, texture, material, and shape while preserving object identity.

Conclusion: Alterbute provides an effective solution for object intrinsic attribute editing that preserves identity and scene context through its combination of relaxed training objectives and Visual Named Entities for scalable supervision.

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

### [69] [WildRayZer: Self-supervised Large View Synthesis in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10716)
*Xuweiyi Chen,Wentao Zhou,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildRayZer is a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis in dynamic scenes that handles both camera and object motion by separating static background from transient objects using analysis-by-synthesis residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments break multi-view consistency assumptions in static NVS models, causing ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. Existing methods struggle with both camera and object motion in casually captured real-world scenes.

Method: Uses analysis-by-synthesis: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, residuals reveal transient regions. Constructs pseudo motion masks from residuals, distills a motion estimator, masks input tokens and gates loss gradients to focus supervision on cross-view background completion.

Result: Outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass. Introduces Dynamic RealEstate10K dataset (15K dynamic sequences) and D-RE10K-iPhone benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: WildRayZer effectively handles dynamic NVS by separating static and transient components through self-supervised analysis-by-synthesis, enabling robust performance on real-world casually captured dynamic scenes with moving cameras and objects.

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.
