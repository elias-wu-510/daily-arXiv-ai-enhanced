*Ho Yin Au,Junkun Jiang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOSControl: A symbolic framework using orientation symbols at keyframes for precise motion control, with automatic extraction from motion data and enhanced constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks lack precise control over body part orientations and motion timing, and existing joint keyframe approaches only provide positional guidance, making orientation specification challenging and unintuitive.

Method: 1) SOS script: programmable symbolic framework for body part orientations and timing at keyframes; 2) Automatic SOS extraction pipeline with temporally-constrained clustering for saliency detection and Saliency-based Masking Scheme; 3) SOSControl framework prioritizes orientation symbol constraints using SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization; 4) ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder for smooth motion outputs.

Result: SOS extraction generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes. SOSControl outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability for motion timing and body part orientation control.

Conclusion: The SOS framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional motion control by providing intuitive orientation and timing specification through symbolic programming, with automatic extraction and enhanced constraint satisfaction mechanisms.

Abstract: Traditional text-to-motion frameworks often lack precise control, and existing approaches based on joint keyframe locations provide only positional guidance, making it challenging and unintuitive to specify body part orientations and motion timing. To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.

TL;DR: Cloud-based multimodal transformer framework achieves SOTA emotion recognition with 3.0% F1-score improvement and 35% latency reduction for real-time HCI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion recognition systems rely on single-modality analysis (facial, speech, text) leading to limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world HCI environments.

Method: Proposes Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework integrating visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, BERT) with cross-modal attention mechanism, deployed on cloud infrastructure with Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet datasets with 3.0% F1-score improvement and 12.9% cross-entropy loss reduction; cloud deployment shows 128ms average latency (35% reduction vs conventional systems).

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition for applications like intelligent customer service and virtual tutoring, representing progress toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage MLLM-driven framework for intelligent power grid drawing review that mimics human expert workflow: global semantic understanding, fine-grained region analysis, and confidence-aware decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated systems fail with ultra-high-resolution power grid drawings due to computational demands, information loss, and lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) MLLM-driven global semantic understanding to propose domain-specific regions from low-resolution overview, 2) High-resolution fine-grained recognition within proposed regions with confidence scores, 3) Comprehensive decision-making module integrating confidence-aware results for error diagnosis and reliability assessment.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings show significant enhancement of MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, with improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

Conclusion: The research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review that mimics human expert workflow through advanced prompt engineering with MLLMs.

Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

### [4] [LURE: Latent Space Unblocking for Multi-Concept Reawakening in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14330)
*Mengyu Sun,Ziyuan Yang,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Junxu Liu,Haibo Hu,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LURE, a method to reawaken erased concepts in diffusion models by reconstructing latent space and guiding sampling trajectories, addressing limitations of existing prompt-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models are vulnerable to reawakening, and current reawakening approaches only use prompt-level optimization, neglecting other generative factors like model parameters and latent states.

Method: Models generation as implicit function to analyze multiple factors (text, parameters, latent states), then proposes LURE with semantic re-binding to reconstruct latent space, Gradient Field Orthogonalization to prevent feature entanglement, and LSIS for stable sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments show LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

Conclusion: LURE provides a comprehensive approach to concept reawakening by addressing multiple generative factors, overcoming limitations of prompt-only methods and enabling robust reawakening of erased concepts.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NASA introduces a multi-spectral aerial wildfire dataset and deep learning model for automated fire perimeter detection, achieving 96% accuracy and 74% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-altitude multi-spectral aerial imagery is scarce and expensive but crucial for wildfire detection applications. Current methods rely on human-intensive fire perimeter determination.

Method: Created human-annotated dataset from NASA AMS with 12-channel imagery (IR, SWIR, thermal). Trained two deep neural networks: one for image classification and another for pixel-level segmentation, combined into real-time segmentation model.

Result: Model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union, and 84% recall, surpassing past methods. Can detect wildfires at nighttime and behind clouds while distinguishing false positives.

Conclusion: Multi-spectral data (especially SWIR, IR, thermal bands) enables robust wildfire detection. The dataset and model advance automated fire perimeter determination for real-time wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.
  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters. Our code and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/nasa/Autonomous-Modular-Sensor-Wildfire-Segmentation/tree/main and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-u4vs9rqwkwgdeeeoUhftCxrfe_4QPTn?=usp=drive_link

*Frank Bieder,Hendrik Königshof,Haohao Hu,Fabian Immel,Yinzhe Shen,Jan-Hendrik Pauls,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XD-MAP transfers semantic knowledge from camera images to LiDAR using parametric maps, enabling 360° perception without manual annotation or sensor overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models depend on dataset availability and alignment with target domains. There's a need to bridge the gap between available datasets (camera images) and deployment domains (LiDAR) without manual annotation.

Method: Leverages detections from camera images to create semantic parametric maps, which are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the LiDAR domain. Enables extending angular perception from front-view camera to full 360° view without requiring sensor overlap.

Result: Outperforms single shot baselines by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation on large-scale road feature dataset.

Conclusion: XD-MAP effectively transfers sensor-specific knowledge from camera to LiDAR, achieving strong performance without manual labeling and enabling full 360° perception from limited camera views.

Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

### [12] [PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530)
*Xiaoyan Kui,Zijie Fan,Zexin Ji,Qinsong Li,Hao Xu,Weixin Si,Haodong Xu,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAS-Mamba is a novel MRI reconstruction framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in frequency domain, uses specialized branches for each, and combines with spatial features using a state space model approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI reconstruction methods treat frequency domain as a whole, neglecting that phase and amplitude carry fundamentally different types of information (phase governs structure, amplitude reflects pixel intensity), leading to interference in feature learning.

Method: Proposes Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) with: 1) LocalMamba in image domain for spatial locality, 2) separate amplitude and phase branches in frequency domain, 3) Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies respecting concentric geometry, 4) Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) for adaptive fusion and bidirectional exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: Decoupling phase and magnitude modeling in frequency domain while combining with spatial features through specialized architecture leads to superior MRI reconstruction by preventing representational coupling and enabling complementary feature learning.

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDT-Net: A dual-teacher, single-student framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that uses dynamic teacher switching and hierarchical consistency to improve boundary learning from sparse annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scribble-supervised methods reduce annotation burden in medical image segmentation, but sparse annotations create ambiguity leading to noisy pseudo-label propagation and poor anatomical boundary learning.

Method: Proposes SDT-Net with: 1) Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher, 2) Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism for high-confidence pseudo-label refinement, and 3) Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module for multi-level feature alignment between teacher and student.

Result: Extensive experiments on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets show state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

Conclusion: SDT-Net effectively addresses scribble annotation ambiguity through its dual-teacher framework with adaptive teacher selection and hierarchical consistency mechanisms, achieving superior segmentation quality.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

Motivation: Existing video inference enhancement methods focus on scaling up models and complex architectures, but overlook the trade-off between resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal performance.

Method: Develops a fuzzy controller (FC-r) based on key system parameters and inference metrics, then proposes a video inference enhancement framework that leverages spatiotemporal correlation of targets across frames and dynamically switches between models of varying scales guided by the FC-r.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

Conclusion: The fuzzy controller-based framework provides an effective solution to dynamically adapt video inference models based on real-time resource conditions, addressing the resource-efficiency trade-off in video inference enhancement.

Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

### [15] [Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion for Brain MRI Progression Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14584)
*Cheng Wan,Bahram Jafrasteh,Ehsan Adeli,Miaomiao Zhang,Qingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-LDM is a segmentation-guided latent diffusion model that simplifies brain MRI progression modeling while enforcing anatomical consistency, outperforming complex multi-stage approaches with better image quality and clinical covariate utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain MRI progression models like BrLP suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of clinical covariates, and limited anatomical consistency guarantees, necessitating a simpler yet more anatomically grounded approach.

Method: AG-LDM uses a segmentation-guided latent diffusion framework that directly fuses baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at input level, avoiding auxiliary control networks. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion training.

Result: On 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs with zero-shot OASIS-3 evaluation, AG-LDM matches or surpasses complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality, 15-20% reduction in volumetric errors, and 31.5x higher sensitivity to clinical covariates than BrLP.

Conclusion: AG-LDM provides an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling that generates biologically plausible trajectories capturing Alzheimer's hallmarks like limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion.

Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers.

### [17] [LFS: Learnable Frame Selector for Event-Aware and Temporally Diverse Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14594)
*Lianying Chao,Linfeng Yin,Peiyu Ren,Yifan Jiang,Qiaoyu Ren,Dingcheng Shan,Jing-cheng Pang,Sijie Wu,Xubin Li,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) improves video captioning by selecting diverse, event-relevant frames using caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs, achieving up to 4% gains on new human-consistent benchmark ICH-CC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform frame sampling for video captioning is inefficient and ignores uneven event distribution, while existing benchmarks don't align well with human cognition.

Method: LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance diversity and relevance, uses stratified strategy for coverage, and learns frame selection by leveraging caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs.

Result: LFS improves detailed video captioning across benchmarks (up to 2.0% on VDC, over 4% on ICH-CC) and enhances video question answering performance.

Conclusion: LFS provides an effective, easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning that better aligns with human understanding.

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces spatial scratchpad - a 3D reasoning substrate for VLMs that bridges text prompts to spatially consistent image generation through 3D mesh instantiation and scene planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual language models lack spatial reasoning mechanisms analogous to LLMs' chain-of-thought, limiting their ability to generate images with accurate geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent.

Method: Parses text prompts into subjects/background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, uses agentic scene planning for placement/orientation/viewpoint selection, then renders back to image domain with identity-preserving cues.

Result: Achieves 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, enables intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably to final images, and produces spatially consistent, visually coherent outputs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates benefits of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation, highlighting a new paradigm where vision-language models deliberate not only in language but also in space.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space. Code and visualizations at https://oindrilasaha.github.io/3DScratchpad/

TL;DR: U-Harmony is a joint training method that enables single segmentation models to learn from heterogeneous medical datasets by normalizing and denormalizing feature distributions to mitigate domain variations while preserving dataset-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation datasets in clinical practice are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Proposes Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony) method that integrates into deep learning architectures with a domain-gated head.

Conclusion: U-Harmony enables a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously, overcoming challenges of limited and diverse medical data in clinical practice while supporting adaptation to new modalities and anatomical targets.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

### [20] [Learning Consistent Taxonomic Classification through Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14610)
*Zhenghong Li,Kecheng Zheng,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-Taxon is a two-stage hierarchical reasoning framework that improves Vision-Language Models' taxonomic classification by enhancing both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency through top-down reasoning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge, leading to errors where they misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying specific leaf levels. Existing approaches overlook hierarchical reasoning.

Method: VL-Taxon uses a two-stage framework: 1) Top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy, 2) Leveraging accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is trained with supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning to refine reasoning and generalization.

Result: VL-Taxon implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-7B model outperforms the original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on iNaturalist-2021 dataset. This significant gain was achieved with fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without using examples from other VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical reasoning framework effectively addresses VLMs' limitations in understanding taxonomic hierarchies, achieving substantial improvements in both accuracy and consistency with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

### [21] [Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14625)
*Yingsong Huang,Hui Guo,Jing Huang,Bing Bai,Qi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEUA framework uses diffusion epistemic uncertainty estimation and asymmetric learning for superior detection of AI-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-generated image detectors fail to distinguish between aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data noise) and epistemic uncertainty (model's lack of knowledge), which undermines detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty creates ambiguity but doesn't help detect generated images, while epistemic uncertainty actually supports detection.

Method: Proposes DEUA framework with two key components: 1) Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty (DEU) estimation using Laplace approximation to measure data proximity to diffusion-generated manifold, and 2) Asymmetric loss function to train balanced classifier with larger margins for better generalizability.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting diffusion-generated images.

Conclusion: The DEUA framework effectively leverages epistemic uncertainty while mitigating aleatoric uncertainty effects, achieving superior detection performance through uncertainty-aware measurement and asymmetric learning.

Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

TL;DR: Forest-Chat: An LLM-driven agent for interactive forest change analysis using satellite imagery, combining change detection, captioning, and reasoning through natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for better forest monitoring tools that can handle both pixel-level change detection and semantic interpretation of complex forest dynamics. While LLMs and VLMs show promise for remote sensing, their integration for forest change analysis remains underexplored beyond urban environments.

Method: Forest-Chat uses an LLM-driven agent with multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone. It incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation model and interactive point-prompt interface for fine-grained user guidance. The system supports multiple tasks: change detection, captioning, object counting, deforestation estimation, and change reasoning.

Result: The system achieves strong performance on the new Forest-Change dataset and LEVIR-MCI-Trees subset for joint change detection and captioning. Results demonstrate the potential of interactive, LLM-driven systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

Conclusion: Forest-Chat represents a significant step toward interactive, LLM-driven remote sensing image change interpretation systems that can enhance forest monitoring workflows by making analysis more accessible, interpretable, and efficient through natural language interaction.

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

*Chenglizhao Chen,Boze Li,Mengke Song,Dehao Feng,Xinyu Liu,Shanchen Pang,Jufeng Yang,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ-Net is an audio-visual depression detection framework that addresses Emotional Ambiguity by adaptively recalibrating emotional features to distinguish depressive symptoms from transient emotional expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-visual depression detection methods either ignore emotional cues (missing subtle depressive signals) or incorporate emotions but confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms, leading to detection errors due to Emotional Ambiguity.

Method: READ-Net uses Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) to dynamically adjust weights of emotional features, preserving depression-relevant cues while filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. It can be integrated into existing frameworks.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three public datasets show READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods with average gains of 4.55% in accuracy and 1.26% in F1-score, demonstrating robustness to emotional disturbances.

Conclusion: READ-Net effectively resolves Emotional Ambiguity in depression detection by adaptively recalibrating emotional features, significantly improving audio-visual depression detection performance and robustness to emotional interference.

Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

*Yonghao Yu,Lang Huang,Zerun Wang,Runyi Li,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirai framework injects future information into autoregressive visual generation training to improve global coherence and accelerate convergence without changing architecture or adding inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive visual generators suffer from diminished global coherence and slow convergence because they're trained with strict causality supervision (next token likelihood only), which optimizes each step only by its immediate next token without considering future context.

Method: Proposes Mirai framework with two variants: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, while Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Both inject future information into AR training without architecture changes or extra inference overhead.

Result: Mirai significantly accelerates convergence (up to 10× faster for LlamaGen-B) and improves generation quality (reduces FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark).

Conclusion: Visual autoregressive models need foresight to improve global coherence and convergence. The Mirai framework effectively injects future information into AR training, demonstrating that aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on 2D image grids improves causality modeling.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

TL;DR: LAVR-4D uses implicit geometric knowledge from a large 4D reconstruction model's latent space to condition video generation, achieving SOTA video re-rendering without explicit reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video re-rendering methods face two main challenges: geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness and suffer from drift/deformation, while geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them vulnerable to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.

Method: The proposed LAVR-4D method uses implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition video generation. These latents capture scene structure in continuous space without explicit reconstruction, providing flexible representation that allows pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors effectively. The model jointly conditions on these latents and source camera poses.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Using implicit geometric knowledge from 4D reconstruction model latents provides an effective solution for video re-rendering, addressing limitations of both unconditioned and explicitly conditioned approaches while leveraging the regularization power of diffusion priors.

Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adversarial neural networks (DANNs) significantly improve cross-domain generalization for adenocarcinoma classification compared to supervised models, with stain normalization effects varying by target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised deep learning models in cancer histopathology fail to generalize beyond their training distribution, creating a need for robust domain adaptation methods to address domain shift and scarcity of annotated medical images.

Method: Evaluated cross-domain classification among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas using ResNet50, ensemble models, and domain adversarial neural networks (DANNs). Also examined stain normalization impact and used Integrated Gradients for feature attribution analysis.

Result: Single-domain ResNet50 achieves >98% accuracy on own domain but minimal generalization to others. DANN trained on breast/colon data adapted to lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy. Stain normalization effects vary: harmful for lung (95.56%→66.60%) but beneficial for breast (49.22%→81.29%) and colon (78.48%→83.36%). DANNs attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions like densely packed nuclei.

Conclusion: Domain adversarial neural networks effectively enable cross-domain generalization for adenocarcinoma classification, learning clinically relevant features that transfer to unlabeled cancer types, though stain normalization requires careful domain-specific consideration.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback network (FeedbackSTS-Det) for infrared small target detection that uses a closed-loop semantic association mechanism with forward/backward refinement modules and structured sparse temporal modeling to handle complex backgrounds with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection under complex backgrounds is challenging due to extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and lack of distinct target features. Existing multi-frame methods struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness.

Method: Proposes FeedbackSTS-Det with a spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy featuring a closed-loop semantic association mechanism. This includes paired forward and backward refinement modules across encoder-decoder, both incorporating embedded sparse semantic modules (SSM) for structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. The method facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: FeedbackSTS-Det provides an effective solution for infrared small target detection in complex backgrounds through its novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy and structured sparse temporal modeling, achieving reliable performance with consistent training-inference pipeline.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) under complex backgrounds remains a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the extremely low signal-to-clutter ratio, persistent dynamic interference, and the lack of distinct target features. While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of FeedbackSTS-Det. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/IDIP-Lab/FeedbackSTS-Det.

### [29] [RegFreeNet: A Registration-Free Network for CBCT-based 3D Dental Implant Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14703)
*Xinquan Yang,Xuguang Li,Mianjie Zheng,Xuefen Liu,Kun Tang,Kian Ming Lim,He Meng,Jianfeng Ren,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method for dental implant position prediction that uses masked post-implantation CBCT data instead of requiring paired pre/post data, enabling easier multi-center dataset construction and eliminating registration steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial surgical guide software doesn't export implant positions, forcing researchers to use time-consuming registration methods that require paired CBCT data, limiting multi-center dataset construction.

Method: Mask implants in post-implantation CBCT data to create training data without registration. Propose ImplantFairy dataset with 1622 CBCT scans, and develop RegFreeNet with neighboring distance perception module and implant slope prediction branch.

Result: RegFreeNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImplantFairy and two public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the registration-free approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method eliminates the need for registration and paired data, enabling large-scale multi-center dataset construction and improving dental implant position prediction.

Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LookBench is a live, holistic benchmark for fashion image retrieval using real e-commerce images and AI-generated fashion images, designed to be updated semi-annually with time-stamped samples to prevent contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion retrieval benchmarks are static and don't reflect real-world e-commerce dynamics, contemporary trends, or the need for contamination-aware evaluation with clear training cutoffs.

Method: Created a benchmark with time-stamped test samples from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, organized around a fine-grained attribute taxonomy covering single-item and outfit-level retrieval.

Result: LookBench is challenging - many strong baselines achieve below 60% Recall@1. The proprietary model performs best, with an open-source counterpart ranking second, both achieving SOTA on legacy Fashion200K.

Conclusion: LookBench provides a durable, evolving measure of progress in fashion retrieval with semi-annual updates, public leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models to advance the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.

*Yiyang Fu,Hui Li,Wangyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPF-CTE framework improves WSSS by capturing contextual patch dependencies and enhancing class-specific semantics, outperforming previous methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSSS methods focus on inter-class distinctions and data augmentation but neglect complex contextual dependencies among image patches, leading to incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes CPF-CTE framework with two key components: 1) CF-BiLSTM module to capture spatial dependencies between patches via bidirectional information flow, and 2) learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

Conclusion: CPF-CTE effectively integrates spatial and semantic cues to produce richer and more accurate image representations, addressing limitations of previous WSSS approaches.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

*Haowei Zhang,Shudong Yang,Jinlan Fu,See-Kiong Ng,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMES is a training-free architecture for real-time streaming video understanding that uses hierarchical KV cache memory to achieve efficient performance with low resource overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with streaming video inputs, failing to maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead simultaneously.

Method: HERMES conceptualizes KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework encapsulating video information across multiple granularities, reusing compact KV cache during inference for efficient streaming understanding.

Result: Achieves 10× faster TTFT than prior SOTA, reduces video tokens by up to 68% compared to uniform sampling while maintaining superior/comparable accuracy across benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

Conclusion: HERMES provides an effective training-free solution for real-time streaming video understanding that balances performance, speed, and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.

TL;DR: DeepMoLM is a dual-view molecular language model that combines high-resolution molecular images with geometric invariants from 3D conformations to improve molecular understanding and generation while preserving stereochemical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining often fail to properly interpret molecular images with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. String/graph-based models lack visual information, while vision-language models miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens.

Method: DeepMoLM uses a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution (1024×1024) molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. It encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, preserves high-frequency evidence from images, and fuses visual and geometric streams using cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without requiring atom coordinates.

Result: DeepMoLM achieves a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over strongest generalist baselines on PubChem captioning while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries, attaining MAE of 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in specialist settings. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Conclusion: DeepMoLM successfully bridges the gap between molecular vision and language by incorporating geometric invariants from 3D conformations, enabling more accurate and physically grounded molecular understanding and generation without requiring explicit atom coordinates.

Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of-the-art vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/1anj/DeepMoLM.

### [34] [Safeguarding Facial Identity against Diffusion-based Face Swapping via Cascading Pathway Disruption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14738)
*Liqin Wang,Qianyue Hu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoidFace is a novel defense method against diffusion-based face swapping attacks that injects imperceptible perturbations to disrupt identity pathways throughout the face swapping pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proactive defenses adapted from image editing attacks are ineffective against diffusion-based face swapping due to overlooking structural resilience and unique static conditional guidance mechanisms in these systems.

Method: VoidFace treats face swapping as a coupled identity pathway and injects perturbations at critical bottlenecks. It uses: 1) localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, 2) attention mechanism decoupling to sever identity injection, and 3) intermediate diffusion feature corruption to prevent source identity reconstruction. Adversarial search in latent manifold with perceptual adaptive strategy ensures visual imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments show VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based face swapping models while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

Conclusion: VoidFace provides an effective systemic defense against diffusion-based face swapping by targeting the unique structural characteristics of these systems, offering both strong protection and visual imperceptibility.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

*Chongbin Yi,Yuxin Liang,Ziqi Zhou,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-edge collaborative framework that combines low-resolution T2I generation with region-aware hybrid super-resolution to reduce latency by 33% while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution text-to-image generation faces a latency-fidelity trade-off: lightweight SR methods struggle with fine details, while diffusion-based SR is computationally expensive. Edge computing supports fast low-resolution generation but high-resolution output requires balancing image fidelity with latency.

Method: End-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework: 1) Generate low-resolution image with adaptive denoising steps and SR scales at edge, 2) Partition into patches, 3) Apply region-aware hybrid SR policy (diffusion-based SR for foreground patches, lightweight learning-based SR for background patches), 4) Stitch enhanced patches into high-resolution image.

Result: System reduces service latency by 33% compared to baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the latency-fidelity trade-off in high-resolution T2I generation through intelligent patch-based processing and hybrid SR methods, enabling efficient high-quality image generation in edge computing environments.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Conclusion: SimD3 is a valuable resource for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse challenging conditions, addressing key limitations of existing datasets through realistic synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning for automated analysis of colon capsule endoscopy images, with broader implications for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining.

*Keita Takeda,Tomoya Sakai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical VLMs learn diagnostically relevant features but non-medical VLMs with enhanced text encoders can produce more refined representations, suggesting text encoder improvement is more crucial than intensive medical image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, but their learned representations remain underexplored. Standard evaluations like classification accuracy don't fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis.

Method: Analyzed feature distributions of multiple image modalities extracted by representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. Compared these distributions with non-medical VLMs to assess domain-specific medical training impact.

Result: Medical VLMs can extract discriminative features effective for medical classification tasks. However, non-medical VLMs with recent improvements like LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases from overlaid text strings on images.

Conclusion: Enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Careful model selection is needed based on downstream tasks, with awareness of potential risks from background biases like textual information in images.

Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

*Xiaofan Yang,Yubin Liu,Wei Pan,Guoqing Chu,Junming Zhang,Jie Zhao,Zhuoqi Man,Xuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2I2HA is a hypergraph-based multi-modal perception network that addresses limitations of CNNs, Transformers, and SSMs by capturing high-order relationships within and across modalities for improved object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal detection methods struggle with extracting task-relevant information, achieving precise cross-modal alignment, and modeling complex dependencies. CNNs have limited receptive fields, Transformers have quadratic complexity, and SSMs disrupt spatial structures when flattening 2D to 1D sequences.

Method: Proposes M2I2HA with three key modules: 1) Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, 2) Inter-Hypergraph Fusion to align and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps, and 3) M2-FullPAD for adaptive multi-level fusion and enhanced data distribution across the architecture.

Result: Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based approach effectively addresses limitations of existing architectures by better capturing complex dependencies within and across modalities, leading to superior multi-modal object detection performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.

*Jiaxuan Liu,Yang Xiang,Han Zhao,Xiangang Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunCineForge is a comprehensive dubbing system that addresses limitations in existing methods by creating a large-scale annotated Chinese TV dubbing dataset and developing an MLLM-based model that outperforms SOTA methods across various cinematic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing movie dubbing methods face two major limitations: (1) lack of high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets with proper annotations, and (2) reliance on lip-only audio-visual alignment which fails in complex cinematic scenes, resulting in poor lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness.

Method: Proposes FunCineForge with two components: (1) an end-to-end production pipeline for creating large-scale dubbing datasets with rich annotations, and (2) an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes (monologue, narration, dialogue, multi-speaker).

Result: Created the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations. Experiments show the dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following across various scene types.

Conclusion: FunCineForge successfully addresses the limitations of existing dubbing methods by providing both high-quality dataset creation pipeline and an advanced MLLM-based model that achieves superior performance across diverse cinematic scenes.

Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

*Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding,Ling Guo,Huaiguang Jiang,Qiong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAM introduces a motion latent space with reconstruction supervision and error guidance to improve text-to-motion diffusion models by addressing representational gaps and error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion diffusion models suffer from two key limitations: 1) representational gap due to pre-trained text encoders lacking motion-specific information, and 2) error propagation during iterative denoising processes.

Method: Two main innovations: 1) Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) with motion latent space as intermediate supervision, co-trained with self-regularization and motion-centric latent alignment objectives. 2) Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG) - a testing-stage guidance mechanism that uses the model's self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation by reconstructing previous estimates and amplifying residuals.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance in text-to-motion generation tasks.

Conclusion: RAM effectively addresses representational gaps and error propagation in motion diffusion models through motion latent space supervision and reconstructive error guidance, achieving superior performance in text-to-motion generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

*Ziyao Ling,Silvia Mirri,Paola Salomoni,Giovanni Delnevo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic images from Stable Diffusion with LoRA can effectively augment limited real datasets for Chinese porcelain classification, with task-specific improvements up to 5.5% F1-macro score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning faces challenges in archaeological artifact classification due to scarce training data, especially for rare Chinese porcelain types. Need effective data augmentation methods to overcome data limitations.

Method: Used Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to generate synthetic images. Employed MobileNetV3 with transfer learning. Conducted controlled experiments comparing pure real data vs. mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln, and type identification.

Result: Task-specific benefits observed: type classification showed most substantial improvement (5.5% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4%), while glaze classification showed minimal improvement. Synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

Conclusion: Generative AI with Stable Diffusion and LoRA can effectively augment archaeological datasets, but effectiveness varies by task. Provides practical guidelines for deploying synthetic data in archaeological research while balancing authenticity with data diversity.

Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

### [44] [UniRoute: Unified Routing Mixture-of-Experts for Modality-Adaptive Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14797)
*Qingling Shu,Sibao Chen,Wei Lu,Zhihui You,Chengzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniRoute is a unified framework for modality-adaptive remote sensing change detection that uses conditional routing to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, achieving strong performance across five datasets with good efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods rely on specialized models that don't scale well across different modalities. Homogeneous CD needs fine spatial details while heterogeneous CD requires broader context, and difference operators work poorly for cross-modal or misaligned data. Specialized models with static backbones or fixed operations are insufficient for modality-adaptive learning.

Method: Proposes UniRoute with: 1) Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) to separate local spatial details from global semantic context, 2) Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) to adaptively select fusion primitives per pixel, and 3) Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) to stabilize training in data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public datasets show UniRoute achieves strong overall performance with favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under unified deployment settings.

Conclusion: UniRoute successfully addresses modality-adaptive change detection by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems, providing a unified framework that works well across different modality settings with good efficiency.

Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

*Qihua Liang,Liang Chen,Yaozong Zheng,Jian Nong,Zhiyi Mo,Bineng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UBATrack is a novel multi-modal object tracking framework using Mamba-style state space models with two key modules: Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter for cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal cues, and Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer for enhanced representation, achieving SOTA results without full-parameter fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal trackers using prompt learning overlook effective capture of spatio-temporal cues, and existing methods require costly full-parameter fine-tuning, limiting training efficiency.

Method: UBATrack uses Mamba-style state space model with two modules: 1) Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) leveraging Mamba's long-sequence modeling for cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal cues via adapter-tuning, and 2) Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer enhancing multi-modal representation across feature dimensions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks (LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, VisEvent datasets).

Conclusion: UBATrack effectively captures spatio-temporal cues while eliminating costly full-parameter fine-tuning, improving training efficiency and achieving superior multi-modal tracking performance across various modalities.

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.

*Donnate Hooft,Stefan M. Fischer,Cosmin Bercea,Jan C. Peeken,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LocBAM, a novel attention mechanism that incorporates location context into patch-based 3D medical image segmentation to improve performance when anatomical context is important.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based methods for 3D medical image segmentation often ignore patch location within the global volume, limiting performance when anatomical context matters. This is especially problematic with low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing.

Method: Introduces LocBAM, a novel attention mechanism that explicitly processes spatial information and location context. It's designed to work with patch-based segmentation approaches and outperforms classical coordinate encoding methods like CoordConv.

Result: Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 datasets show that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage conditions. LocBAM consistently outperforms CoordConv.

Conclusion: Location context is important for patch-based 3D medical image segmentation, and the proposed LocBAM attention mechanism effectively incorporates this spatial information to enhance segmentation performance, especially when global context is limited.

Abstract: Patch-based methods are widely used in 3D medical image segmentation to address memory constraints in processing high-resolution volumetric data. However, these approaches often neglect the patch's location within the global volume, which can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important. In this paper, we investigate the role of location context in patch-based 3D segmentation and propose a novel attention mechanism, LocBAM, that explicitly processes spatial information. Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing. Furthermore, LocBAM consistently outperforms classical coordinate encoding via CoordConv. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/compai-lab/2026-ISBI-hooft

*Tobias Weißberg,Weikang Wang,Paul Roetzer,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a feature disentanglement approach for symmetry-aware shape descriptors with refinement to address limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors are one-dimensional, neglect other semantic information, and are noisy with misclassified patches.

Method: Feature disentanglement approach that is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic, plus feature refinement technique to improve robustness of predicted symmetry informative features.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness in intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing symmetry-informative feature extraction methods through disentanglement and refinement techniques.

Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $χ$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Bert Ramlot,Martijn Courteaux,Peter Lambert,Glenn Van Wallendael*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTR is a post-training compression codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that reduces storage requirements while maintaining quality and accelerating inference through novel pruning and lighting coefficient optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers faster training and inference than NeRF but has substantially higher storage requirements. The authors aim to address this storage bottleneck without sacrificing the speed advantages of 3DGS.

Method: POTR introduces two novel techniques: 1) A pruning approach using a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate each splat's removal effect simultaneously, achieving 2-4x fewer splats than other methods. 2) A method to recompute lighting coefficients to reduce entropy without training, increasing AC lighting coefficient sparsity from 70% to 97%. The system also includes an optional fine-tuning scheme for further enhancement.

Result: POTR achieves 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models, significantly reduces splat count (2-4x fewer than other post-training pruning), and dramatically increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity (70% to 97%) with minimal quality loss. Without fine-tuning, it consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: POTR successfully addresses the storage limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting while maintaining its speed advantages, offering a practical solution for real-time 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Abstract: Melanoma detection is vital for early diagnosis and effective treatment.

This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy. It employs a multi-modal neural network combining image and metadata processing and supports a two-step model for cases with or without metadata. A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microtubules are essential cytoskeletal filaments and therapeutic targets, but their segmentation is challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. Current methods struggle with these complexities, creating a need for more accurate segmentation tools.

Method: MTFlow uses a time-conditioned flow-matching model with a U-Net backbone and temporal embeddings. Instead of predicting masks directly, it learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward ground truth through trajectory-based refinement, enabling interpretable uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries.

Result: MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and real microtubule datasets. It also demonstrates strong generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of other curvilinear structures like retinal blood vessels and nerves.

Conclusion: MTFlow provides a powerful, time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis that offers more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches, with interpretable refinement through learned vector fields.

Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

Method: Proposes GAT-NeRF, a hybrid neural radiance field framework that integrates Transformer mechanism into NeRF pipeline. Combines coordinate-aligned MLP with lightweight Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) module that processes multi-modal inputs (3D spatial coordinates, 3DMM expression parameters, learnable latent codes) to enhance feature representations for fine-grained geometry.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, significantly improving modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

Conclusion: GAT-NeRF forges new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications by synergistically combining MLP and Transformer architectures to overcome limitations of traditional NeRF for facial detail reconstruction.

Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

Motivation: The paper aims to create a unified representation for embodied spatial intelligence that can handle real-world indoor environments captured casually, enabling interpretable reasoning over spatial relations without specialized sensors.

Method: The system reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments from egocentric RGB video, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as a scaffold, and builds a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes linking visual evidence, embeddings, and textual descriptions to 3D coordinates.

Result: Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes show SpatialMem maintains strong navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, supporting language-guided navigation and object retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: SpatialMem offers an efficient, extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single queryable representation from casual RGB video.

Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

Method: Created TempViz dataset with 7.9k prompts and 600+ reference images to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge. Studied five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories using human evaluation, and examined automated evaluation methods by comparing them against human judgments.

Result: Temporal competence is generally weak across all models, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Automated evaluation methods fail to provide reliable assessment of temporal cues, further highlighting the need for better evaluation approaches.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I models, as current models struggle with temporal understanding and existing evaluation methods are inadequate for assessing temporal competence.

Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

*Xinyu Peng,Han Li,Yuyang Huang,Ziyang Zheng,Yaoming Wang,Xin Chen,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDF-VFI is a video frame interpolation method that uses a video-centric diffusion transformer with skip-concatenate sampling for long-range temporal consistency, enabling 4K resolution processing without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFI methods process videos as independent short segments, causing temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by developing a holistic, video-centric approach that ensures long-range temporal coherence.

Method: Proposes LDF-VFI with: 1) Auto-regressive diffusion transformer modeling entire video sequences, 2) Skip-concatenate sampling strategy to mitigate error accumulation, 3) Sparse local attention and tiled VAE encoding for efficient long-sequence processing, 4) Enhanced conditional VAE decoder with multi-scale features from input video.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion. Can generalize to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining.

Conclusion: LDF-VFI successfully addresses temporal inconsistency in video frame interpolation through a holistic video-centric approach with diffusion transformers, achieving both high quality and temporal coherence while being computationally efficient for long sequences.

Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

*Nilanjana Chatterjee,Sidharatha Garg,A V Subramanyam,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-TBPS proposes a unified model for text-based person search across multiple datasets, addressing limitations of dataset-specific fine-tuning through noise-aware dataset curation and scalable identity learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TBPS methods rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning due to limited training data and VLMs not being pre-trained for pedestrian recognition, requiring multiple independent models for different datasets. Synthetic data doesn't solve dataset-specific adaptation, motivating the need for a single unified model.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets, and (2) scalable discriminative identity learning framework effective with large numbers of unique identities.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 show that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms both dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training approaches.

Conclusion: Scale-TBPS successfully demonstrates that a single unified model can be trained across multiple TBPS datasets, overcoming limitations of current training paradigms through noise-aware curation and scalable identity learning.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

*Xiaodong Wang,Langling Huang,Zhirong Wu,Xu Zhao,Teng Xu,Xuhong Xia,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiViBench: First omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos with 24 tasks, plus LiVi-LLM-7B model that outperforms larger models on livestream understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation benchmarks focus on non-interactive videos (movies, recordings), creating a gap for interactive livestream video understanding which involves real-time comments, audio, and speech modalities.

Method: 1) Created LiViBench with standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow using multi-agent MLLM system and seed-question-driven annotation. 2) Developed LiVi-LLM-7B with two-stage instruction-tuning and Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module for better real-time comment utilization.

Result: LiVi-LLM-7B outperforms larger open-source models (up to 72B parameters), narrows gap with proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks (VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoEval-Pro).

Conclusion: The paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark for interactive livestream videos and demonstrates that specialized instruction-tuning with real-time comment integration significantly improves multimodal understanding of interactive content.

Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset, and a visual-guided spatial audio generation framework that produces realistic spatial audio from video, outperforming existing methods in spatial fidelity and immersive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-to-audio generation models focus mainly on semantic and temporal alignment but neglect spatial perception and immersive quality, largely due to reliance on mono audio datasets that lack binaural spatial information needed for visual-to-spatial audio mapping.

Method: Two key contributions: 1) Construction of BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset; 2) An end-to-end spatial audio generation framework with visual-guided audio spatialization module that explicitly models spatial features while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment.

Result: The approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the spatial perception gap in video-to-audio generation by introducing both a novel dataset and framework, enabling realistic spatial audio generation from visual cues and advancing immersive multimedia experiences.

Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

*Andrea Protani,Riccardo Taiello,Marc Molina Van Den Bosch,Luigi Serio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning framework enables brain tumor localization across institutions without sharing patient data, matching centralized performance while providing explainable insights into MRI modality importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor analysis requires large datasets but privacy regulations prevent data sharing across institutions, creating data silos that limit model development and generalization.

Method: Federated learning framework using hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture deployed in CAFEIN platform, with explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms.

Result: Federated learning enables continued model improvement beyond isolated training, matching centralized performance. Explainability analysis shows deeper layers increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

Conclusion: Federated learning is justified for complex medical tasks with high-dimensional data as it aggregates knowledge from multiple institutions while preserving privacy, and attention mechanisms provide clinically relevant explainability.

Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

*Isaac Baglin,Xiatian Zhu,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new federated learning attack uses flow matching generative priors to reconstruct private client data from model updates, outperforming existing methods across various metrics and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep leakage attacks in federated learning suffer from instability, limited fidelity, and poor robustness under realistic settings. There's a need for more effective reconstruction methods that can work across different FL scenarios and defenses.

Method: Integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process, guiding optimization toward realistic image distributions using a flow matching foundation model without requiring knowledge of the private data.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses like noise injection, clipping, and sparsification.

Conclusion: The attack demonstrates the vulnerability of federated learning to adversaries with powerful generative priors, calling for development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for such threats.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel differential privacy framework using Error Feedback SGD with reconstruction loss and noise injection to generate high-quality synthetic images while maintaining privacy, achieving SOTA results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data masking techniques like anonymization fail to balance privacy protection and data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data is important for generating training samples while preventing information leakage, but existing methods suffer from repeated trade-offs between privacy and utility.

Method: Proposes a differential privacy generation framework using Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent (EFSGD) with reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism during training to generate synthetic images with better privacy-utility trade-off.

Result: Achieves higher quality and usability images under the same privacy budget compared to related work. Demonstrates effectiveness and generalization for both grayscale and RGB images, achieving state-of-the-art results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA benchmarks across almost all metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the privacy-utility trade-off in synthetic data generation for privacy-preserving machine learning, providing a more effective solution than traditional anonymization methods and existing synthetic data generation approaches.

Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

*Tianyu Li,Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Ping Hu,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play framework that improves CLIP-based foreground-background decomposition for few-shot OOD detection by adaptively suppressing background patches and rectifying confusable foreground patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods have limitations: uniform background suppression ignores varying patch contributions, and foreground regions may contain patches similar to other classes that mislead training.

Method: Three components: 1) FG-BG Decomposition module (similar to previous methods), 2) Adaptive Background Suppression module (weights patch classification entropy adaptively), 3) Confusable Foreground Rectification module (identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches).

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly improves performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods for few-shot OOD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed plug-and-play framework effectively addresses limitations of existing FG-BG methods by adaptive background suppression and confusable foreground rectification, enhancing few-shot OOD detection performance.

Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

*Jingyang Huo,Yikai Wang,Yanwei Fu,Jianfeng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictorialCortex enables zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction by modeling fMRI activity with compositional latent formulation and using multi-dataset training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent variability of cortical responses to the same visual stimulus across individuals and trials makes fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. There's a need for zero-shot cross-subject reconstruction where visual experiences of unseen individuals can be reconstructed without subject-specific training.

Method: Proposes PictorialCortex with compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. Uses latent factorization-composition module with consistency regularization. For inference, aggregates surrogate latents from multiple seen subjects to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects.

Result: Extensive experiments show PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, demonstrating benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles the challenging problem of zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction by addressing cortical response variability through compositional latent modeling and leveraging multi-dataset training.

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based garment simulation is computationally expensive, while existing GNN-based approaches suffer from poor cross-resolution generalization, with significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond training distribution due to fixed message-passing depth and resolution-dependent displacement magnitudes.

Method: Introduces Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet) with two key mechanisms: 1) dynamic propagation depth control that adjusts message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and 2) geometry-aware update scaling that scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics, decoupling message propagation from feature updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Pb4U-GNet, even when trained solely on low-resolution meshes, exhibits strong generalizability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing the fundamental challenge of cross-resolution generalization in neural garment simulation.

Conclusion: Pb4U-GNet provides a resolution-adaptive framework that enables effective neural garment simulation with strong cross-resolution generalization, overcoming limitations of existing GNN approaches and making neural garment simulation more practical for time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS is a training-free multi-stage adversarial reasoning framework for hateful video detection that uses objective description, evidence-based reasoning, and counter-evidence reasoning to produce reliable and interpretable hate detection decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hateful video detection methods face limitations: training-based approaches are constrained by limited data and lack interpretability, while direct prompting of large vision-language models often fails to provide reliable hate detection. Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety.

Method: MARS is a training-free multi-stage adversarial reasoning framework with four stages: 1) Objective description of video content to establish neutral foundation, 2) Evidence-based reasoning supporting potential hateful interpretations, 3) Counter-evidence reasoning capturing plausible non-hateful perspectives, and 4) Synthesis of perspectives into conclusive and explainable decisions.

Result: Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches, and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. MARS also produces human-understandable justifications.

Conclusion: MARS provides a reliable and interpretable solution for hateful video detection that addresses limitations of existing methods, supports compliance oversight, and enhances transparency in content moderation workflows through its adversarial reasoning approach.

Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of promptable segmentation models (like SAM) to natural variations in bounding box prompts, revealing high sensitivity to user input variability and introducing BREPS for adversarial bounding box generation to evaluate robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training and evaluation protocols for promptable segmentation models rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness to natural variations in user-provided bounding boxes.

Method: 1) Conducted a controlled user study collecting thousands of real bounding box annotations; 2) Reformulated robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over bounding box prompt space; 3) Introduced BREPS method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints.

Result: Analysis revealed substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. BREPS enables systematic robustness benchmarking across 10 datasets spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

Conclusion: Promptable segmentation models show significant sensitivity to natural variations in bounding box prompts, highlighting the need for robustness evaluation beyond synthetic prompts. BREPS provides a framework for systematic robustness assessment across diverse domains.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraSP is a unified framework for visual graph recognition that works across diverse graph types and drawings without task-specific modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual relationship recognition (modeled as graph extraction from images) remains challenging due to lack of canonical approaches. Existing solutions are problem-specific and not transferable between contexts despite addressing the same conceptual problem.

Method: GraSP (Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction) - a method designed for broad applicability and simplicity that recognizes graphs in images through subgraph prediction.

Result: The method works across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application, demonstrating effectiveness with diverse graph types and drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications.

Conclusion: GraSP paves the way toward a more unified framework for visual graph recognition, addressing the fragmentation in current approaches to this challenging problem.

Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated except for crowded scenes, creating a need for better performance in challenging multi-person environments.

Method: PMPose introduces probabilistic formulation and mask-conditioning for top-down 2D pose estimation. BMPv2 integrates PMPose with an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module for improved accuracy.

Result: BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 AP points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. Also improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes via 2D prompting.

Conclusion: Advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation, and multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than detection. The method demonstrates strong performance on crowded scenes.

Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

Conclusion: Hybrid ensemble strategies show potential for producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease classification, with Evan_V2 outperforming all standalone models.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenDi integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models for urban scene generation, using 3D Gaussians for coarse geometry and camera control, then enhancing details with 2D video diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D diffusion models lose appearance details, while 2D-only approaches compromise camera controllability. Urban scene generation needs both realistic details and accurate camera control.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians for coarse scene geometry with optional conditioning (bounding boxes, road maps, text). 2) Train 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details using rendered images from 3D Gaussians as guidance.

Result: Experiments on Waymo and KITTI-360 datasets show ScenDi effectively generates urban scenes with realistic details while maintaining accurate camera trajectory adherence.

Conclusion: ScenDi successfully integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models to overcome limitations of single-modality approaches, achieving both detailed appearance and camera controllability in urban scene generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with task progress estimation from partial observations; Progress-Bench benchmark shows most models fail at progress reasoning, but training-based ProgressLM-3B improves performance despite being trained on disjoint tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs excel at describing visible content, it's unclear if they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations, which requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than static visual recognition.

Method: Introduced Progress-Bench benchmark for evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs; explored human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning through training-free prompting and training-based approach using curated dataset ProgressLM-45K.

Result: Most of 14 tested VLMs are not ready for task progress estimation - sensitive to demonstration modality/viewpoint changes, poor at handling unanswerable cases. Training-free prompting yields limited gains, but training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at small scale and with disjoint training/evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: Progress reasoning remains challenging for current VLMs; structured training approaches show promise but current models have characteristic error patterns in handling progress estimation from partial observations.

Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

TL;DR: 2D projection-based pipeline for cervical spine fracture detection in 3D CT volumes using optimized projections for localization, segmentation, and ensemble fracture classification with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical spine fractures require precise detection for clinical management. Traditional 3D segmentation methods are computationally complex, so the study explores more efficient 2D projection-based approaches while maintaining performance.

Method: End-to-end pipeline: 1) 3D volume approximation via optimized 2D axial/sagittal/coronal projections, 2) YOLOv8 for ROI localization (94.45% 3D mIoU), 3) DenseNet121-Unet multi-label segmentation using variance/energy projections (87.86% Dice), 4) 2.5D Spatio-Sequential ensemble models for fracture detection using raw slices and projections.

Result: Vertebra-level F1: 68.15, patient-level F1: 82.26; ROC-AUC: 91.62 (vertebra) and 83.04 (patient). Competitive performance compared to expert radiologists in interobserver variability analysis.

Conclusion: 2D projection-based approach effectively reduces computational complexity while maintaining high performance for cervical spine fracture detection, validated through explainability studies and comparison with radiologists.

Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward methods for semantic scene completion from monocular RGB images struggle with generating plausible details in occluded regions and preserving spatial relationships, which is critical for real-world applications like autonomous systems.

Method: FlowSSC treats SSC as conditional generation problem, introduces Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in compact triplane latent space, enabling high-fidelity generation in single step instead of hundreds of diffusion steps.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI show state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines while enabling real-time inference.

Conclusion: FlowSSC is the first generative framework for monocular SSC that can integrate with existing methods to boost performance and enable practical deployment in autonomous systems through real-time inference.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: RayRoPE: A novel positional encoding for multi-view transformers that uses ray-based encoding with predicted 3D points for geometry-aware, SE(3)-invariant attention with uncertainty handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing positional encodings for multi-view transformers fail to uniquely encode patches, achieve SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and adapt to scene geometry.

Method: RayRoPE represents patch positions using associated rays but leverages predicted 3D points along rays instead of directions. It computes query-frame projective coordinates for SE(3) invariance and analytically computes expected position encoding under uncertainty when predicted 3D points are imprecise.

Result: RayRoPE consistently outperforms alternative position encoding schemes, achieving 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D for novel-view synthesis. It also enables seamless incorporation of RGB-D input for larger gains.

Conclusion: RayRoPE addresses key limitations of prior multi-view positional encodings by providing geometry-aware, SE(3)-invariant encoding with uncertainty handling, leading to significant performance improvements in 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

TL;DR: StableWorld introduces a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism to address instability and temporal inconsistency in interactive video generation by filtering degraded frames to prevent error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive video generation methods suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation during long-horizon interactions, leading to spatial drift and scene collapse, which limits practical applications despite progress in world modeling.

Method: Proposes StableWorld with a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism that continuously filters out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones to prevent cumulative drift at its source.

Result: StableWorld demonstrates substantial improvements in stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios when applied to multiple interactive video models (Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, Hunyuan-GameCraft).

Conclusion: StableWorld is a simple yet effective, model-agnostic solution that addresses the core stability challenges in interactive video generation by preventing error accumulation through dynamic frame filtering.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models for robotics lack standardized evaluation benchmarks, making fair comparisons difficult, and suffer from insufficient high-quality training data that accurately captures real-world robotic interactions and physical realism.

Method: 1) Developed RBench benchmark with five task domains and four embodiments, assessing task correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible metrics (structural consistency, physical plausibility, action completeness). 2) Created RoVid-X dataset using a refined four-stage data pipeline, producing 4 million annotated video clips with comprehensive physical property annotations.

Result: RBench evaluation of 25 models revealed significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. The benchmark achieved 0.96 Spearman correlation with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. RoVid-X became the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation.

Conclusion: The synergistic ecosystem of RBench benchmark and RoVid-X dataset establishes a foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating embodied AI toward general intelligence by addressing both evaluation standardization and training data shortages.

Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: EgoWM transforms pretrained video diffusion models into action-conditioned world models for accurate future prediction across various embodiments, achieving better physical correctness and faster inference than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models can imagine plausible futures but not necessarily correct ones that accurately reflect how the world changes with specific actions. The authors aim to create models that can predict correct futures conditioned on motor commands.

Method: EgoWM repurposes pretrained video diffusion models by injecting motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers rather than training from scratch. This preserves the rich world priors from Internet-scale video models while enabling action-conditioned future prediction.

Result: The method scales across embodiments from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, produces coherent rollouts for navigation and manipulation tasks, improves Structural Consistency Score by up to 80% over prior methods, achieves 6x lower inference latency, and generalizes to unseen environments including navigation inside paintings.

Conclusion: EgoWM demonstrates that lightweight conditioning on pretrained video diffusion models can create effective action-conditioned world models that accurately predict correct futures while maintaining realism and strong generalization across diverse embodiments and environments.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

TL;DR: Iterative test-time refinement strategy for text-to-image models using vision-language model feedback to improve compositional prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models struggle with complex compositional prompts requiring multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies like parallel sampling or increasing denoising steps remain inadequate for richly compositional settings.

Method: Proposes iterative test-time strategy where T2I model progressively refines generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as critic. Simple, requires no external tools/priors, flexibly applicable to various image generators and VLMs.

Result: 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial), 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga. Human evaluators prefer method 58.7% vs 41.3% for parallel baseline. Produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections.

Conclusion: Iterative self-correction is a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation, demonstrating consistent gains across benchmarks and producing more faithful generations through sequential refinement.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates quantization methods for multimodal pipelines, showing that both vision transformers and language models are equally important for performance despite parameter differences, and that aggressive LLM quantization achieves high accuracy with reduced bits per weight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require significant GPU memory and latency, creating deployment challenges. While quantization research exists for single models, there's limited work on how quantization affects multimodal pipelines combining vision models, language models, and connectors.

Method: Applied various quantization methods (including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ) to multimodal pipelines. Investigated how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering is affected by bit width, quantization method, and which pipeline components are quantized.

Result: Vision transformers and language models show comparable importance to overall performance despite significant parameter size differences. Lower-bit quantization of LLMs achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw).

Conclusion: Provides practical insights for efficient MLLM deployment and highlights the value of exploring component sensitivities in multimodal models. The findings help optimize quantization strategies across different multimodal pipeline components.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

### [84] [APPLE: Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling for Diffusion-Based Face Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15288)

TL;DR: APPLE is a diffusion-based teacher-student framework for face swapping that uses attribute-preserving pseudo-labeling to improve both identity transfer and target attribute fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face swapping faces two key challenges: lack of real ground truth data, and difficulty preserving target-specific attributes (pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, makeup). Existing diffusion-based methods using masked conditional inpainting lose crucial appearance cues, leading to misaligned attributes.

Method: APPLE uses a teacher-student framework with attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. It reformulates face swapping as conditional deblurring to preserve target attributes, introduces attribute-aware inversion for detailed preservation, and creates high-quality pseudo triplets through elaborate attribute-preserving teacher learning.

Result: APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful face swapping results compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed APPLE framework successfully addresses the core challenges of face swapping by combining attribute-preserving pseudo-labeling with diffusion-based conditional deblurring, enabling high-fidelity identity transfer while maintaining target-specific attributes.

Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.
