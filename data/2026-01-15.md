*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhixiong Zeng,Xuanle Zhao,Deyang Jiang,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FD-RL uses entropy-based filtering and format-specific rewards to improve OCR performance on formatted text like formulas and tables, achieving state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced OCR models struggle with formatted text (formulas, tables, etc.), showing significantly higher entropy than plain text, indicating high output uncertainty and the need for better reasoning over diverse reading pathways.

Method: Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning (FD-RL) with entropy-based data filtration to identify format-intensive instances, and format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types for format-level validation rather than token-level memorization.

Result: Achieves average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting new record for end-to-end models on this popular benchmark. Comprehensive ablation studies validate effectiveness of data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies.

Conclusion: FD-RL effectively addresses OCR limitations on formatted text through targeted optimization based on entropy patterns and format-specific rewards, significantly improving performance on complex document structures.

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

The paper aims to address bias propagation and robustness degradation, particularly focusing on how rotation and distributional shifts affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns.

Method: The paper proposes rotation-robust mitigation strategies combining data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization to address robustness and fairness issues in vision-language and generative models under rotation-induced perturbations.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models, addressing both robustness degradation and bias propagation under input transformations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

### [3] [R$^2$BD: A Reconstruction-Based Method for Generalizable and Efficient Detection of Fake Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08867)
*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²BD is a novel fake image detection framework that uses a unified reconstruction model (G-LDM) to simulate multiple generative paradigms and a single-step residual bias calculation, achieving 22× speedup and 13.87% better cross-dataset accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction-based AIGC detection methods rely on diffusion models and multi-step processes, limiting their efficiency and generalization to other generative paradigms like GANs. There's a need for faster, more versatile detection that works across different AI generation methods.

Method: R²BD introduces two key designs: (1) G-LDM - a unified reconstruction model that simulates generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real vs fake images in a single inference step instead of 20+ steps.

Result: The framework achieves over 22× faster inference than existing reconstruction-based methods while maintaining superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations on 10 public datasets, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87%.

Conclusion: R²BD demonstrates strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods, addressing key limitations of current reconstruction-based detection approaches while broadening the detection scope beyond diffusion-only models.

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods. The code and dataset used for evaluation are available at https://github.com/QingyuLiu/RRBD.

*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Bin Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRFN uses bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams for better multimodal fusion in audio-visual embodied navigation, outperforming SOTA methods with improved cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge in audio-visual embodied navigation is effectively modeling interactions between heterogeneous audio and visual features during multimodal fusion, avoiding single-modality dominance or information degradation, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network (CRFN) with bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams for complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment while maintaining representation independence. Uses residual connections and stabilization techniques instead of simple concatenation or attention gating.

Result: CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines on Replica and Matterport3D datasets and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Also reveals that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets.

Conclusion: CRFN effectively addresses multimodal fusion challenges in audio-visual embodied navigation. The discovery of differentiated modality dependence provides new perspective for understanding cross-modal collaboration mechanisms in embodied agents.

Abstract: Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.

### [5] [ForensicFormer: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Reasoning for Cross-Domain Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08873)
*Hema Hariharan Samson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForensicFormer is a hierarchical multi-scale framework for cross-domain forgery detection that combines low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning using transformers, achieving 86.8% average accuracy across diverse test sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forensic methods are ineffective against modern AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools, especially for cross-domain forgery detection where manipulation techniques are unknown beforehand.

Method: A hierarchical multi-scale framework using cross-attention transformers that unifies three levels: low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning.

Result: Achieves 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets (vs. <75% for prior methods), maintains 83% accuracy under JPEG compression (vs. 66% for baselines), and provides pixel-level forgery localization with 0.76 F1-score.

Conclusion: ForensicFormer bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori, with interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

### [6] [Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875)
*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-Net addresses cross-domain image registration by disentangling scene geometry from appearance variations, enabling registration through re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration under domain shift is challenging because systematic intensity differences violate the brightness constancy assumption, making conventional registration methods ill-posed for cross-domain alignment.

Method: Proposes SAR-Net framework that decomposes images into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, using scene consistency loss and domain alignment losses to enable registration via re-rendering.

Result: Achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC on bidirectional scanning microscopy data, representing 3.1x improvement over strongest baseline while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps).

Conclusion: Scene-appearance disentanglement provides a principled solution for cross-domain registration, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation showing significant performance improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively. Code and data are available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET.

### [7] [The Semantic Lifecycle in Embodied AI: Acquisition, Representation and Storage via Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08876)
*Shuai Chen,Hao Chen,Yuanchen Bei,Tianyang Zhao,Zhibo Zhou,Feiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey paper proposing a "Semantic Lifecycle" framework to analyze how foundation models are reshaping semantic processing in embodied AI, covering acquisition, representation, and storage stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic information in embodied AI is multi-source and multi-stage, making it hard to achieve stable perception-to-action loops. Traditional approaches with manual engineering and deep neural networks work for specific tasks but struggle with complex environments and open-ended tasks requiring generalizable semantic processing.

Method: Proposes the "Semantic Lifecycle" as a unified framework to characterize semantic knowledge evolution in embodied AI driven by foundation models. This holistic perspective captures continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge, departing from traditional isolated modules. Analyzes recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive analysis of how foundation models are reshaping embodied AI research through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors. It offers a systematic framework for understanding semantic knowledge evolution in embodied systems.

Conclusion: Foundation models address the challenge of generalizable semantic processing in embodied AI. The Semantic Lifecycle framework provides a holistic perspective for analyzing semantic knowledge evolution. The paper summarizes existing challenges and outlines promising future research directions in this emerging field.

Abstract: Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

### [8] [TAG-MoE: Task-Aware Gating for Unified Generative Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08881)
*Yu Xu,Hongbin Yan,Juan Cao,Yiji Cheng,Tiankai Hang,Runze He,Zijin Yin,Shiyi Zhang,Yuxin Zhang,Jintao Li,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Tong-Yee Lee,Fan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework that injects semantic intent into Mixture-of-Experts routing to resolve task interference in unified image generation/editing models, transforming task-agnostic gating into a semantic-aware dispatch center.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified image generation and editing models using dense diffusion transformers suffer from severe task interference, where shared parameters must compromise between conflicting objectives. While sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is promising, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating on local features without awareness of global task intent, preventing meaningful specialization and failing to resolve task interference.

Method: The authors propose: 1) Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (scope, type, preservation), and 2) Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with high-level task semantics, evolving the gating network from task-agnostic executor to semantic-aware dispatch center.

Result: The model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality. Analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations through the semantic-aware routing mechanism.

Conclusion: Injecting semantic intent into MoE routing through hierarchical task annotation and predictive alignment regularization successfully resolves task interference in unified image models, transforming gating networks into effective dispatch centers that enable meaningful expert specialization.

Abstract: Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

### [9] [Compressing Vision Transformers in Geospatial Transfer Learning with Manifold-Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08882)
*Thomas Snyder,H. Lexie Yang,Stefan Schnake,Steffen Schotthöfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DLRT framework compresses geospatial foundation models for edge devices using manifold-constrained optimization during transfer learning, achieving high compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial foundation models are too large for resource-constrained edge devices, and existing compression methods cause significant accuracy loss, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Uses DLRT (manifold-constrained optimization framework) to compress vision transformer-based geospatial models during transfer learning by enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream tasks.

Result: Outperforms standard low-rank methods like LoRA, achieves substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss on diverse geospatial benchmarks, enabling high-performing on-device models.

Conclusion: DLRT enables practical deployment of compressed geospatial foundation models on edge devices by maintaining task-specific accuracy while significantly reducing model size.

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

### [10] [Adaptive few-shot learning for robust part quality classification in two-photon lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08885)
*Sixian Jia,Ruo-Syuan Mei,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive computer vision framework for quality control in two-photon lithography manufacturing that handles novelty detection, few-shot incremental learning, and domain adaptation using a shared backbone model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision models for quality control in additive manufacturing are static and ineffective in dynamic environments - they can't detect new defect classes, update efficiently from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries.

Method: Three-part framework: 1) LDA-based statistical hypothesis testing for novelty detection, 2) rehearsal-based few-shot incremental learning for new classes, 3) few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for domain adaptation, all built on same scale-robust backbone model.

Result: Novelty detection achieved 99-100% accuracy, incremental learning reached 92% accuracy with only 20 samples per new class, and domain adaptation achieved 96.19% accuracy on target domain with just 5 shots.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining computer vision quality control models in evolving manufacturing environments, addressing key limitations of static models.

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabricating high-precision micro-structures. While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAMSA-UNet improves brain tumor segmentation by combining uncertainty-aware Bayesian modeling with multi-scale attention, achieving better accuracy and computational efficiency than U-Net baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and U-Net based brain tumor segmentation methods often produce noisy boundaries in tumor infiltration regions, which is problematic for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: UAMSA-UNet uses Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty-aware Bayesian modeling, fuses multi-scale features with attention maps, and employs a smoothing-regularized loss combining binary cross-entropy with variance penalty across stochastic forward passes.

Result: On BraTS2023: 3.3% Dice and 2.7% IoU improvement over U-Net. On BraTS2024: 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over best baseline. Also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% relative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining multi-scale attention with learned smoothing prior achieves better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, providing a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

Conclusion: Thermo-LIO highlights the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure, providing superior defect detection capabilities compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

### [13] [SAM-pose2seg: Pose-Guided Human Instance Segmentation in Crowds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08982)
*Constantin Kolomiiets,Miroslav Purkrabek,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapting SAM 2.1 for pose-guided human segmentation with occlusion handling using minimal encoder modifications and a PoseMaskRefine fine-tuning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with occlusion where keypoints are partially or fully invisible, requiring improved robustness for pose-guided human segmentation in challenging scenarios.

Method: Adapt SAM 2.1 with minimal encoder modifications, use PoseMaskRefine fine-tuning strategy to incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into SAM's iterative correction process, and during inference select only the three highest visibility keypoints for simplified prompting.

Result: Improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets, reduced sensitivity to common errors (missing body parts, misclassified clothing), and accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint.

Conclusion: Pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the original model's generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model.

### [14] [Instance camera focus prediction for crystal agglomeration classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09004)
*Xiaoyu Ji,Chenhao Zhang,Tyler James Downard,Zoltan Nagy,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining camera focus prediction with instance segmentation to accurately classify crystal agglomeration in microscopic images by distinguishing in-focus vs out-of-focus crystals at different depth layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crystal agglomeration analysis from 2D microscopic images is challenging because overlapping crystals at different depth layers may appear connected but don't constitute true agglomeration, and traditional methods can't distinguish depth information effectively.

Method: Uses an instance camera focus prediction network to quantify camera focus (2-class focus level), then combines this with an instance segmentation model for agglomeration classification, distinguishing crystals at different depth layers based on focus information.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than baseline models on both ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal datasets.

Conclusion: Focus-aware instance segmentation effectively addresses the depth ambiguity problem in crystal agglomeration analysis, providing more accurate classification by leveraging focus information to distinguish between true agglomeration and overlapping crystals at different depths.

Abstract: Agglomeration refers to the process of crystal clustering due to interparticle forces. Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.

Motivation: To understand how image and signal properties impact visual attention mechanisms during signal detection tasks in medical imaging, particularly for improving pattern recognition in complex heterogeneous backgrounds where misdiagnosis still occurs despite radiologists' expertise.

Method: Used simulated tomographic breast images with digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT) containing two types of lesions with distinct spatial frequency properties. Six human observers participated in an eye-tracking study detecting 3-mm sphere and 6-mm spicule lesions in DBT slices, with gaze data collected to analyze visual attention mechanisms.

Result: Detection performance is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for most errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by target morphology and background complexity, showing critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Spiculated lesions received longer fixation durations, indicating differential visual attention engagement based on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.

Conclusion: Visual attention mechanisms in medical image analysis are significantly affected by both target characteristics and background complexity, with decision-making processes being a major bottleneck in detection performance. Understanding these interactions can inform improved imaging protocols and diagnostic training.

Abstract: We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.

*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation using blockwise self-supervised learning, achieving representations close to end-to-end baselines while revealing different learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation, addressing the underexplored application of blockwise self-supervised learning to video modeling and the sparse analysis comparing BWSSL and end-to-end training dynamics.

Method: Apply blockwise learning to masked autoencoding video vision transformers by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics.

Result: Blockwise training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. It exposes higher-level structure earlier, with later blocks saturating and operating in a geometry-preserving regime, showing token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing.

Conclusion: Blockwise training is viable for masked video transformers, achieving competitive performance while revealing different learning dynamics. Late-block saturation and interface formation contribute to the remaining performance gap with end-to-end training.

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

### [17] [Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078)
*Junze Shi,Yang Yu,Jian Shi,Haibo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STDTrack is a lightweight object tracking framework that integrates spatiotemporal dependencies through dense video sampling, temporal propagation tokens, and multi-frame information fusion to bridge performance gaps while maintaining real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight trackers use sparse sampling (one template + one search image per sequence), which fails to explore comprehensive spatiotemporal information in videos, creating a performance gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers.

Method: Proposes STDTrack with: 1) Dense video sampling for spatiotemporal information utilization, 2) Temporally propagating spatiotemporal token for per-frame feature guidance, 3) Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM) using historical context, 4) Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM) with quality-based update, and 5) Multi-scale prediction head for scale variation adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. On GOT-10k, rivals high-performance non-real-time trackers like MixFormer while operating at 192 FPS (GPU) and 41 FPS (CPU).

Conclusion: STDTrack successfully bridges the performance gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers by effectively integrating spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining real-time efficiency, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive video information utilization in object tracking.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

TL;DR: A method for localizing planetary rovers in aerial maps using cross-view neural networks trained on synthetic data and validated with real-world planetary analogue data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future planetary missions require advanced autonomy for ground-aerial robotic teams, but real space data with ground-truth labels is scarce for training machine learning localization systems.

Method: Cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks using semantic segmentation with vision foundation models, trained on high-volume synthetic data to bridge domain gaps, combined with particle filters for state estimation over image sequences.

Result: The approach enables accurate position estimation over both simple and complex rover trajectories using sequences of ground-view RGB images.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses the data scarcity problem in planetary robotics by leveraging synthetic data and cross-view networks, contributing new datasets and enabling accurate localization for future ground-aerial robotic missions.

Abstract: Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.

*Yanguang Sun,Chao Wang,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEFT: A dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm that efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to optical remote sensing image segmentation with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale foundation models offer stronger performance potential for remote sensing image segmentation, but full-parameter fine-tuning is impractical due to excessive GPU memory consumption and computational costs. Existing methods rely on moderate-scale models, limiting exploration of large-scale models.

Method: Proposes WEFT with two key components: 1) Task-specific wavelet expert extractor that models wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulates outputs to generate trainable features, and 2) Expert-guided conditional adapter that injects trainable features to enhance fine-grained perception of frozen features and iteratively updates both feature types for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms 21 state-of-the-art methods on three optical remote sensing image datasets, and achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Conclusion: WEFT provides an efficient fine-tuning paradigm that enables practical use of large-scale foundation models for remote sensing image segmentation while maintaining high performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-Aug leverages Segment Anything Model's geometry-aware segmentation to improve few-shot land cover mapping from time-series remote sensing images without additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is challenging due to scarce labeled data. While supervised models perform well with full labels, their performance degrades significantly with limited annotations, limiting real-world applicability in data-scarce regions.

Method: Constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences, applies SAM in unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors, integrates priors via RegionSmoothLoss that enforces prediction consistency within SAM-derived regions across temporal frames.

Result: Achieves mean test mIoU of 36.21% (5% labeled setting), outperforming SOTA baseline by +2.33pp (6.89% relative improvement). Best split reaches 40.28% mIoU (11.2% relative gain). Consistent improvement across all seeds confirms generalization power.

Conclusion: Vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering scalable plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes slow4fast-VLN, a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework for Vision-Language Navigation that enables agents to adapt to unseen environments and instructions through experience-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLN methods assume training and test data share similar styles, but real-world navigation requires adaptation to diverse unseen environments and inconsistent instructions. The paper addresses the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task to learn generalized navigation ability.

Method: Proposes slow4fast-VLN with two interactive modules: 1) Fast-reasoning module - an end-to-end strategy network that outputs actions in real-time and accumulates execution records in a history repository; 2) Slow-reasoning module - analyzes memories from fast reasoning, extracts generalization-enhancing experiences through deep reflection, and structurally stores them to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module.

Result: The framework enables continuous adaptation and efficient navigation in unseen scenarios by leveraging experience-based learning through fast-slow interaction, unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed slow4fast-VLN framework effectively addresses the GSA-VLN task by enabling agents to dynamically produce generalized strategies through interactive fast-slow reasoning, improving adaptation to diverse unseen environments and instructions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.

### [22] [LP-LLM: End-to-End Real-World Degraded License Plate Text Recognition via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09116)
*Haoyan Gong,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework for license plate recognition that addresses misalignment between restoration and recognition objectives by introducing character-aware reasoning with learnable slot queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LPR suffers from severe degradations (motion blur, low resolution, complex illumination). The traditional "restoration-then-recognition" approach has misaligned objectives - pixel-level restoration doesn't align with semantic recognition goals, causing artifacts and error accumulation. While VLMs have strong general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (fixed length, specific order).

Method: End-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. Core innovation: Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM) with learnable Character Slot Queries. These queries retrieve fine-grained evidence for character positions from visual features via cross-attention, then inject character-aware representations back into visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling language model to perform autoregressive generation with explicit structural priors. Uses LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation while retaining large model generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets show the method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs.

Conclusion: Validates superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks, addressing the fundamental misalignment between restoration and recognition objectives in degraded LPR scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Framework bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offers practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work: further model compression for real-time deployment.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, including high computational complexity, excessive parameter counts, and suboptimal accuracy. We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\% in $S_α$, +0.86\% in IOU, and +1.77\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability. The proposed framework effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering substantial practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work will focus on further model compression for real-time deployment.

*Xin Yuan,Meiqi Wan,Wei Liu,Xin Xu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CenterPolar is a novel single-domain generalized deep metric learning framework that uses class-centric polarization with centrifugal expansion and centripetal constraint to handle both category and domain shifts during testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDG-DML methods use proxy-based expansion that generates samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in real-world applications. This limits generalization to both unseen categories and domains.

Method: CenterPolar uses two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: 1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion (C³E) that shifts source data away from class centroids to generalize to more unseen domains, and 2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint (C⁴) that pulls all samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation to consolidate domain-invariant class information.

Result: Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate superiority and effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CenterPolar effectively addresses the dual challenge of category and domain shifts in SDG-DML by dynamically expanding and constraining domain distributions, learning a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions.

Abstract: Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkinFlow introduces a framework that optimizes visual information transmission efficiency for dermatology diagnosis, achieving state-of-the-art results with a 7B model by addressing "diffuse attention" in large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often fail in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to separate subtle pathological lesions from background noise. The paper challenges the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision.

Method: SkinFlow uses a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy that sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space.

Result: The 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over massive general-purpose models like Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2.

Conclusion: Optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling, demonstrating that medical precision can be achieved through architectural and algorithmic innovations rather than just scaling model size.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.

TL;DR: SSVP introduces a synergistic prompting framework for zero-shot anomaly detection that fuses diverse visual encodings to balance semantic generalization with fine-grained structural perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods are limited by single visual backbones that struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability, creating a gap in effective industrial inspection.

Method: Proposes Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP) with three key components: 1) Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into CLIP semantic space, 2) Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) uses cross-modal attention for dynamic prompt generation, 3) Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes dual-gated calibration to address global-local discrepancy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0% Image-AUROC and 92.2% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches across seven industrial benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSVP effectively bridges the gap between semantic generalization and structural discriminability in zero-shot anomaly detection through synergistic visual encoding fusion, demonstrating robust performance for industrial inspection applications.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0\% Image-AUROC and 92.2\% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

*Jamie Magrill,Leah Gornstein,Sandra Seekins,Barry Magrill*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenAI text-to-image systems have limited accuracy in generating architectural imagery, with only 42% average accuracy across platforms, showing better performance on common vs rare architectural prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capacity of generative AI text-to-image systems to reproduce accurate architectural imagery in a historically rule-bound field, as these systems are increasingly used for architectural visualization despite unknown accuracy.

Method: Evaluated five GenAI platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (600 total). Two architectural historians independently scored images for accuracy against predefined criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Set-level performance summarized as 0-4 accurate images per four-image set.

Result: Common prompts produced 2.7x more accurate images than rare prompts. Overall accuracy was limited (highest 52%, lowest 32%, mean 42%). All-correct outcomes were similar across platforms, but all-incorrect outcomes varied substantially (Imagen 3 had fewest failures, Microsoft Image Generator had most). Qualitative analysis identified recurring errors: over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and revivals, misrepresentation of descriptive prompts.

Conclusion: Findings support need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery due to limited accuracy and systematic errors.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEIoU YOLOv9 is a lightweight detection framework using a novel bounding box regression loss (NEIoU) that combines non-monotonic gradient focusing with geometric decoupling to improve detection of small, low-contrast agricultural disease targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural disease detection often involves small, low-contrast targets that are challenging for standard detection methods. Existing bounding box regression losses like CIoU struggle with weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap, leading to suboptimal performance in agricultural monitoring applications.

Method: Proposes NEIoU (Non-monotonic Efficient IoU) loss that reshapes localization gradients by combining non-monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization. This enhances weak regression signals for hard samples while reducing gradient interference. The loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a custom rice leaf disease dataset.

Result: Achieves 90.3% mAP, a 4.3% improvement over CIoU baseline, with better localization accuracy under strict evaluation. When deployed on Android with TensorFlow Lite Float16 quantization, maintains accuracy with 156ms average inference time per frame.

Conclusion: NEIoU YOLOv9 effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge-based agricultural monitoring systems, demonstrating practical viability for real-world deployment on mobile devices.

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation framework creates compact medical image segmentation models for on-premises clinical deployment while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical deployment of medical image segmentation models is constrained by on-premises infrastructure with fixed computational resources and governance restrictions that limit cloud inference. High-capacity models have accuracy but impractical computational demands for hospital environments.

Method: Deployment-oriented framework using knowledge distillation to translate high-performing segmentation models into scalable family of compact student models without modifying inference pipeline. Preserves architectural compatibility while enabling systematic capacity reduction.

Result: Evaluated on multi-site brain MRI dataset (1,104 3D volumes) with independent testing on 101 curated cases, plus abdominal CT for cross-modality generalizability. With 94% parameter reduction, distilled student preserves 98.7% of teacher's accuracy, achieves 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation provides practical pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

TL;DR: Point-Seg: Transformer-based myocardium segmentation using point tracking for temporal consistency in echocardiography videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography is challenging due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Existing methods either ignore temporal information or use memory-based feature propagation that accumulates errors over time.

Method: Proposes Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as temporal cue. Uses point-tracking module trained on synthetic echocardiography data to track anatomical landmarks, providing explicit motion-aware signal to guide segmentation. Includes temporal smoothing loss for enhanced consistency.

Result: Achieves statistically similar Dice accuracy to SOTA in high-quality echo data, better accuracy in lower-quality data with improved temporal stability. Provides pixel-level myocardium motion information essential for downstream tasks like strain measurement and wall motion abnormality detection.

Conclusion: Point tracking serves as effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

*Qiang Hu,Qimei Wang,Yingjie Guo,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PaGKD is a novel pairing-free group-level knowledge distillation framework that enables effective cross-modal learning from unpaired WLI and NBI endoscopic images, eliminating the need for costly paired lesion images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models require paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, which is costly and impractical, leaving vast amounts of clinical data untapped.

Method: PaGKD operates at group level with two modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) extracts modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries, and (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment using group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets show PaGKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2% respectively.

Conclusion: PaGKD establishes a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data by enabling effective knowledge transfer without requiring image-level correspondence, making it practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

TL;DR: Affostruction: A generative framework for affordance grounding that reconstructs complete 3D shapes from partial RGBD observations and predicts affordances on both visible and unobserved regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing affordance grounding methods only predict affordances on visible surfaces, but many objects have occluded or unobserved regions that are important for understanding complete affordance capabilities.

Method: Three core contributions: 1) Generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion for complete shape reconstruction, 2) Flow-based affordance grounding to capture ambiguity in affordance distributions, 3) Affordance-driven active view selection for intelligent viewpoint sampling.

Result: Achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Conclusion: Affostruction successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by reconstructing complete geometry and grounding affordances on both observed and unobserved regions, significantly improving performance on both affordance grounding and 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOL-SD: Annealed relaxed speculative decoding for faster autoregressive image generation with theoretical grounding and improved speed-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation suffers from slow inference due to sequential nature and image token ambiguity, even with speculative decoding. Existing relaxed speculative decoding methods lack theoretical foundation.

Method: Proposes COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding based on two theoretical insights: 1) Analysis of TV distance between target model and relaxed SD yields optimal resampling distribution minimizing distance upper bound, 2) Perturbation analysis reveals annealing behavior motivating annealed design.

Result: COOL-SD generates images faster with comparable quality, or achieves better quality at similar latency. Experiments show consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: COOL-SD provides theoretically-grounded annealed relaxed speculative decoding that effectively addresses slow inference in autoregressive image generation, offering superior speed-quality trade-offs compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: Vision-language representation learning for infrared object detection using textual supervision to disentangle object features from noisy infrared images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared object detection faces challenges due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, making it difficult to extract discriminative features for robust detection in complex environments where visible cameras fail.

Method: Proposes a vision-language representation learning paradigm with two key modules: 1) Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) to align object features with corresponding text features, and 2) Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) to separate text-aligned object features from non-object features by minimizing their correlation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks: 83.7% mAP on M³FD and 86.1% mAP on FLIR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances infrared object detection performance by leveraging textual supervision to extract more discriminative and less noisy object features through vision-language representation learning.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

Motivation: Current forensic identification methods struggle when DNA evidence is unavailable. Existing deep learning face recognition methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between different forensic modalities like skeleton/sketch and face images.

Method: 1. Construct superpixel-based graphs from images; 2. Use different GNN backbones to extract graph embeddings; 3. Establish cross-domain correspondence through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism; 4. Unified framework for matching skulls/sketches to faces.

Result: Significant improvement in identification metrics (Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines on IIT_Mandi_S2F and CUFS datasets. Framework demonstrates high effectiveness for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Conclusion: SPOT-Face provides an effective solution for cross-domain forensic face identification, addressing the challenge when traditional DNA evidence is unavailable, with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Result: Ultra-compact variant matches SuperPoint accuracy with only 0.004M parameters (99.7% size reduction). High-performance configuration outperforms all SOTA methods including DINOv2-based frameworks while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices.

Conclusion: CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence applications.

Abstract: Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices. These results demonstrate that CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Substation meters are critical for power grid monitoring, but defect detection is hampered by severe scarcity of annotated samples, creating a few-shot generation challenge that needs to be addressed for effective industrial inspection systems.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding to bridge domain gap between natural images and industrial equipment; 2) Geometric crack modeling module parameterizing defect attributes to produce spatially constrained control maps; 3) Lightweight hypernetwork dynamically modulating the diffusion denoising process based on control maps and defect descriptors.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare, enabling realistic and controllable generation of defect images from limited data.

Abstract: Substation meters play a critical role in monitoring and ensuring the stable operation of power grids, yet their detection of cracks and other physical defects is often hampered by a severe scarcity of annotated samples. To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.
  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.
  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.
  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.
  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU benchmark and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

Conclusion: DeTracker effectively addresses tracking challenges in unstabilized satellite videos through explicit motion decoupling and temporal feature enhancement, demonstrating superior performance on both simulated and real-world data.

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

*Sheng-Chi Hsu,Ting-Yu Yen,Shih-Hsuan Hung,Hung-Kuo Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A²TG introduces adaptive anisotropic textures for Gaussian splats, replacing fixed square textures with gradient-guided resolution/aspect ratio allocation to reduce memory while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing textured Gaussian approaches use fixed square textures per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. This wastes resources and doesn't align with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats.

Method: Introduces adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A²TG) that equip each primitive with anisotropic textures. Uses a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with Gaussian splat anisotropy.

Result: A²TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

Conclusion: The adaptive anisotropic texture approach significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality in Gaussian Splatting representations.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

*Yiwei Zhang,Jin Gao,Hanshi Wang,Fudong Ge,Guan Luo,Weiming Hu,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-DETR enhances DETR-style object detectors by using multiple LoRA branches with diverse one-to-many assignment strategies during training to provide rich supervision, improving convergence without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-to-one matching in DETR-style detectors suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. Existing one-to-many approaches add complex modifications and lack unified design. The paper finds that assignment diversity, not just quantity, drives performance gains.

Method: Proposes LoRA-DETR framework that adds multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each implementing different one-to-many assignment rules. These auxiliary branches inject diverse supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness across different baselines. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining architectural simplicity and adding no computational cost during inference.

Conclusion: Diverse one-to-many supervision can be elegantly integrated into DETR-style detectors via LoRA branches, creating a new paradigm for enhancing detectors without compromising model elegance or inference efficiency.

Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.

TL;DR: A compact visual place recognition system using event-based sensors and guided VAE with spiking neural networks for efficient mobile robot navigation in GPS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need precise localization in GPS-denied indoor environments. Current VPR models are either too memory-intensive for mobile deployment or lack robustness and generalization capabilities.

Method: Combines event-based vision sensors with a guided variational autoencoder (VAE) using spiking neural network encoder compatible with neuromorphic hardware for power efficiency.

Result: Successfully disentangles visual features of 16 distinct places in new indoor VPR dataset with classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Shows robust performance under various illumination conditions and can distinguish novel visual inputs from unknown scenes.

Conclusion: The compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities presents a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyRPR is a three-stage training-free pipeline that decouples physical reasoning from visual synthesis to improve physical plausibility in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generation models struggle with physical constraints because they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis in a single-stage approach, making explicit physical reasoning difficult.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) PhyReason - uses large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and image generator for keyframe synthesis; 2) PhyPlan - deterministically synthesizes controllable coarse motion scaffold; 3) PhyRefine - injects scaffold into diffusion sampling via latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving planned dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability under physics constraints.

Conclusion: The staged design enables explicit physical control during generation by decoupling physical understanding from visual synthesis, addressing limitations of single-stage approaches.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BAM-MRCD is a deep learning model that uses multi-resolution MODIS and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to create detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution for timely wildfire monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for wildfire mapping require high-resolution multispectral data, but operational wildfire monitoring needs timely delineation of burn scars. There's a trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency in current satellite systems that limits operational applicability.

Method: Proposes BAM-MRCD, a novel deep learning model that employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (combining MODIS and Sentinel-2 data) to leverage both high temporal frequency and high spatial resolution.

Result: The model successfully detects even small-scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models and solid baselines. It enables timely production of detailed burnt area maps.

Conclusion: BAM-MRCD addresses the operational limitation of wildfire monitoring by combining multi-resolution satellite data, providing a practical solution for quick burn scar delineation after wildfire incidents. All code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

TL;DR: BrainSegNet adapts SAM for whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions using enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with U-Net skip connections and boundary refinement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on HCP dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole-brain parcellation is critical but challenging due to complex, irregular brain regions. Traditional template-registration methods are being replaced by deep learning, but large models like SAM lack the precision needed for brain parcellation.

Method: BrainSegNet adapts SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules: hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling, and boundary refinement module for edge sharpening.

Result: Experimental results on HCP dataset show BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

Conclusion: BrainSegNet successfully adapts SAM for precise whole-brain parcellation, demonstrating superior performance through architectural enhancements tailored for fine-grained anatomical precision.

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

TL;DR: GaussianFluent: A framework for realistic brittle fracture simulation and rendering using 3D Gaussian Splatting with synthesized interiors and optimized continuum damage MPM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous physics simulation with 3DGS focused on soft, deformable materials but couldn't handle brittle fracture due to lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures and fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians.

Method: 1) Synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. 2) Integrates optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) for high-speed brittle fracture simulation.

Result: Handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors previously infeasible.

Conclusion: GaussianFluent demonstrates capability for realistic simulation and rendering of brittle fracture, highlighting potential for downstream applications like VR and Robotics.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

*Lianying Chao,Haoran Cai,Xubin Li,Kai Zhang,Sijie Wu,Rui Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-stage training strategy for Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, achieving better performance than larger models with only 7B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain knowledge in ICT exists in both text and images, but traditional methods can't caption images and multi-modal LLMs lack sufficient domain knowledge. Need specialized model for ICT image understanding.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: 1) Synthesize 7K image-text pairs using Mermaid tool + LLMs for first-stage SFT, 2) Expert-annotated 2K pairs for second-stage SFT, 3) Expert+LLM synthesized 1.5K VQA data for instruction-based SFT.

Result: DICModel with 7B parameters outperforms 32B parameter SOTA models: increases BLEU by 56.8% vs 7B models and 20.8% vs 32B models. Beats Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% accuracy on ICT domain expert questions.

Conclusion: The proposed DICModel efficiently extracts logical text from ICT images, promoting multimodal model development in the ICT domain through specialized training strategy.

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

TL;DR: A novel frequency error-guided MRI reconstruction framework using conditional diffusion models and joint optimization of under-sampling patterns and reconstruction networks, achieving superior performance across multiple imaging modalities and acceleration rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-contrast MRI reconstruction methods suffer from superficial reference fusion strategies, insufficient utilization of complementary information from reference scans, and fixed under-sampling patterns, limiting their effectiveness in clinical applications.

Method: Proposes a frequency error-guided framework with: 1) conditional diffusion model to learn Frequency Error Prior (FEP), 2) joint optimization of under-sampling patterns and reconstruction networks, 3) model-driven deep unfolding framework exploiting frequency- and image-domain information, 4) spatial alignment module, and 5) reference feature decomposition strategy.

Result: Demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by integrating frequency error priors, joint optimization, and improved interpretability through bridging model-based optimization with data-driven learning, offering a promising solution for accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear probing (freezing backbone, training lightweight head) is computationally efficient but limited to last-layer representations, while task-relevant information is actually distributed across all network layers rather than just the last ones.

Method: Attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all Vision Transformer layers. It learns to identify the most relevant layers for each target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions.

Result: Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, the method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations.

Conclusion: Task-relevant information is distributed across network hierarchy, not just last layers. Attentive probing provides a principled, task-aware approach to unlock the potential of intermediate layer information for efficient adaptation of foundation models.

Abstract: With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with video tasks due to memory constraints from dense frame processing. Existing VMR methods use sparse frame sampling which risks information loss, especially in long videos. There's a need for memory-efficient approaches that maintain high information resolution.

Method: SMORE framework uses three key techniques: (1) query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant video segments, and (3) adaptive frame compression to preserve key content while reducing redundancy.

Result: SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three major benchmarks: QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions, demonstrating superior video understanding while maintaining memory efficiency.

Conclusion: The SMORE framework successfully addresses memory constraints in video processing by intelligently encoding, modulating, and compressing video content, enabling efficient video understanding without sacrificing performance on moment retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved image recognition and reasoning, but video-related tasks remain challenging due to memory constraints from dense frame processing. Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.

*Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Haijian Shao,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAP uses spectral reconstruction of complex interaction fields to measure channel redundancy for neural network pruning, achieving 90% FLOP reduction with minimal accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods often rely on simple heuristics like filter norm magnitudes, which may not accurately capture functional redundancy at the channel level. There's a need for more principled approaches that measure how much information each channel contributes to the network's function.

Method: For each convolutional layer, create complex interaction fields by pairing multi-channel input activations (real part) with single output-channel activations (imaginary part). Transform to frequency domain, train low-capacity autoencoders to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels with high reconstruction fidelity are considered redundant and prunable.

Result: On VGG16/CIFAR-10: 90.11% FLOP reduction, 96.30% parameter reduction with only 1.67% absolute Top-1 accuracy drop from 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning. Shows spectral reconstruction fidelity effectively identifies channel-level redundancy.

Conclusion: Spectral reconstruction of complex interaction fields provides an effective proxy for measuring channel redundancy, enabling aggressive network compression while maintaining performance through principled, reconstruction-based pruning.

Abstract: We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel methods for enhancing high-frequency details in image super-resolution: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling/downscaling process, achieving state-of-the-art results with CNN models and improving attention-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image super-resolution is crucial for real-world applications, and enhancing fine details (high-frequency information) is essential for quality improvement. Current methods may not sufficiently emphasize high-frequency components that contribute to image details.

Method: Two main methods: 1) Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss that guides models by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images, 2) Repeated upscaling and downscaling process that amplifies detail loss effectiveness by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features.

Result: The CNN-based model incorporating these methods achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all available CNN-based and some attention-based models. When applied to existing attention-based models, the detail loss consistently improves performance compared to original models.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures by better focusing on high-frequency components, demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness in improving image quality.

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals.

*Yaxi Chen,Zi Ye,Shaheer U. Saeed,Oliver Yu,Simin Ni,Jie Huang,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep learning approach with radiomic features for automated necrosis quantification in osteosarcoma, addressing performance drops in patient-level generalization and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual histopathological assessment of viable vs non-viable tumor regions in osteosarcoma after chemotherapy is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Existing deep learning models show significant performance drops when evaluated on patient-level test data compared to tile-level performance reported in previous studies.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Incorporation of radiomic features as multimodal input alongside images to improve performance and interpretability. 2) Hierarchical classification approach with two binary tasks (tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable) using trainable weightings, instead of flat three-class classification.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improved classification performance on the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset. The multimodal input with radiomic features enhanced performance, and the hierarchical loss with trainable weightings improved per-class performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results for this application.

Conclusion: The combination of radiomic features as multimodal input and hierarchical classification with trainable weightings effectively addresses patient-level generalization challenges in osteosarcoma necrosis quantification, providing improved accuracy and interpretability for clinical applications.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

*Rui Zhu,Xin Shen,Shuchen Wu,Chenxi Miao,Xin Yu,Yang Li,Weikang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-MSR is the first benchmark for evaluating multi-hop spatial reasoning in dynamic video scenarios, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs and showing improvement through specialized instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving complex visual-spatial logical chains underexplored. There's a need to evaluate multi-hop spatial reasoning capabilities in dynamic video scenarios.

Method: Created Video-MSR benchmark with 3,052 video instances and 4,993 QA pairs across four tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Used scalable pipeline combining model generation with human verification. Also curated MSR-9K instruction-tuning dataset and fine-tuned Qwen-VL.

Result: Evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed significant limitations - models show proficiency in surface-level perception but suffer from spatial disorientation and hallucination in multi-step deductions. Fine-tuning Qwen-VL with MSR-9K achieved +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR.

Conclusion: Video-MSR establishes a vital foundation for evaluating multi-hop spatial reasoning, highlighting current model limitations and demonstrating the efficacy of specialized instruction data for improving spatial reasoning capabilities in dynamic video scenarios.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.

*Ahmad Rahimi,Valentin Gerard,Eloi Zablocki,Matthieu Cord,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient adaptation of general video diffusion models into controllable driving world models using decoupled motion learning and appearance synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models generate realistic videos but lack structured motion and physical consistency needed for autonomous driving world models. Domain adaptation typically requires massive data and costly fine-tuning.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adapt model to predict structured motion using skeletonized agents/scene videos (focus on physical/social plausibility), 2) Reuse same backbone to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on motion sequences ("dressing" motion with texture/lighting).

Result: Matching prior SOTA with <6% compute when adapting SVD. MAD-LTX outperforms all open-source competitors and supports comprehensive text, ego, and object controls.

Conclusion: Decoupled motion-appearance approach enables efficient adaptation of generalist video models into reliable driving world models with minimal supervision, following a reasoning-rendering paradigm.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively "dressing" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

### [59] [Towards Robust Cross-Dataset Object Detection Generalization under Domain Specificity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09497)
*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Hrishit Mitra,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through setting specificity, revealing that transfer within same setting types is stable while cross-setting transfer drops significantly, with domain shift being the dominant factor in hardest regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detectors perform well in-distribution but degrade sharply on different benchmarks. The paper aims to understand cross-dataset object detection through the lens of setting specificity to characterize transfer patterns and identify key challenges.

Method: Group benchmarks into setting-agnostic (diverse everyday scenes) and setting-specific (narrow environment) datasets. Evaluate standard detector family across all train-test pairs. Compare closed-label transfer with open-label protocol using CLIP similarity to map predicted classes to nearest target label, disentangling domain shift from label mismatch.

Result: Reveals clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. Most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, with many corrected cases corresponding to semantic near-misses supported by image evidence.

Conclusion: Provides principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift. Domain shift dominates in hardest regimes, and open-label alignment helps but has limited gains, indicating fundamental challenges in cross-setting transfer.

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

### [60] [V-DPM: 4D Video Reconstruction with Dynamic Point Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09499)
*Edgar Sucar,Eldar Insafutdinov,Zihang Lai,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-DPM extends Dynamic Point Maps to video input, achieving state-of-the-art 3D/4D reconstruction by adapting VGGT with synthetic data to predict full 3D motion of every scene point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) are limited to image pairs and require optimization for multiple views, making them impractical for video applications where dynamic 3D reconstruction from sequences is needed.

Method: Formulates DPMs for video input to maximize representational power and enable neural prediction, then implements on VGGT architecture with adaptation using synthetic data to predict both dynamic depth and full 3D motion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes, recovering not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

Conclusion: V-DPM successfully extends DPMs to video applications, demonstrating that modest synthetic data can adapt static scene models to dynamic reconstruction while capturing comprehensive 3D motion information.

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-JEPA pre-training for facial expression recognition achieves state-of-the-art results on RAVDESS and outperforms vision-based methods on CREMA-D, demonstrating strong generalization through embedding-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video pre-training methods rely on pixel-level reconstructions which capture irrelevant information. The paper aims to leverage V-JEPA's embedding-based approach to focus on relevant facial expression features while ignoring irrelevant background details.

Method: Use pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder (which learns by predicting embeddings of masked regions from unmasked regions), then train shallow classifiers on RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets for facial expression recognition.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperformed all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Cross-dataset evaluations showed strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Embedding-based pre-training approaches like V-JEPA have strong potential to advance facial expression recognition by focusing on relevant features and ignoring irrelevant information, with demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and generalization.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.

### [63] [Bipartite Mode Matching for Vision Training Set Search from a Hierarchical Data Server](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09531)
*Yue Yao,Ruining Yang,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical data server with bipartite mode matching (BMM) to align source and target modes for unsupervised domain adaptation when real-time target annotation is infeasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Target domains often have distinct semantic clusters (modes), and if training sets don't contain these target modes, model performance suffers. Existing works focus on improving algorithms, but this research explores optimizing data server structure instead.

Method: Introduces hierarchical data server inspired by web search engines, with bipartite mode matching (BMM) algorithm to align source and target modes. For each target mode, searches server data tree for best mode match (large or small), using bipartite matching for one-on-one optimal matching between target and source modes.

Result: Matched server modes create training sets with consistently smaller domain gaps across object re-identification and detection tasks. Models trained on these searched sets have higher accuracy. BMM enables data-centric UDA orthogonal to model-centric methods, and combining BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling yields further improvements.

Conclusion: BMM provides a data-centric approach to unsupervised domain adaptation that complements existing model-centric methods, demonstrating effectiveness through hierarchical data server structure and bipartite mode matching to better align source and target domain distributions.

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

*Shuyang Xiang,Hao Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chinese character visual forms (8×8 grayscale images) can replace token IDs in language modeling, achieving comparable accuracy with faster early learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs treat Chinese characters as discrete tokens ignoring their visual structure, which contains semantic and phonetic information that could aid prediction.

Method: Use grayscale images of individual Chinese characters (as low as 8×8 pixels) as input to a decoder instead of token IDs, testing in low-resolution visual settings.

Result: Visual inputs achieve 39.2% accuracy vs 39.1% for index-based baseline. Shows "hot-start" effect: by 0.4% training, visual models reach >12% accuracy while token models lag at <6%.

Conclusion: Minimal visual structure provides robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative to traditional index-based character representation.

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

TL;DR: DF-DiffCom is a KAN-enhanced diffusion model that uses deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain MRI completion, outperforming SOTA methods and being modality-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal brain MRI studies suffer from high attrition rates leading to missing data. Existing deep generative models rely solely on image intensity, resulting in limited fidelity/trustworthiness and restricted usage flexibility due to fixed guidance in model structure.

Method: DF-DiffCom is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for longitudinal brain image completion. It's trained on OASIS-3 dataset.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. The modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities and even to attribute maps like brain tissue segmentation results.

Conclusion: DF-DiffCom addresses key limitations of existing methods by providing trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion with improved fidelity and greater flexibility for versatile application scenarios.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVoxel is a training-free algorithm for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding that groups sparse voxels into objects and captions them using VLMs/MLLMs, enabling tasks like OVS and RES without CLIP/BERT embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks without requiring training or introducing embeddings from text encoders like CLIP/BERT, which can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to complex scenes.

Method: OpenVoxel takes sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) from multi-view images, groups voxels into meaningful object segments, then uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to caption each group via text-to-text search, building an informative scene map.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks, while being training-free and avoiding CLIP/BERT embeddings.

Conclusion: OpenVoxel provides an effective training-free approach for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding that leverages modern VLMs/MLLMs through text-to-text search, offering strong performance on complex tasks like RES with code availability.

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.

Motivation: Handwriting is an essential educational skill, but providing visual feedback on handwritten documents is understudied despite its importance for learning.

### [68] [Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM) method for fine rigid pairwise 3D Point Cloud Registration: A Focus on the Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09601)
*Emmanuele Barberi,Felice Sfravara,Filippo Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel differential entropy-based metric called IDEM is proposed for robust 3D point cloud registration, addressing limitations of traditional Euclidean distance metrics like RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional point cloud registration methods using Euclidean distances (RMSE, Chamfer, Hausdorff) have limitations: they require choosing a fixed point cloud, are sensitive to density differences, noise, holes, and limited overlap, and often need preprocessing. These methods work best with well-prealigned point clouds but fail in real-world scenarios where both point clouds may have issues.

Method: The authors introduce Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM), a novel differential entropy-based metric that serves as the objective function in an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration. This metric is commutative (doesn't require choosing a fixed point cloud) and reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment during transformations.

Result: Multiple case studies show IDEM outperforms traditional metrics (RMSE, Chamfer distance, Hausdorff distance) in challenging scenarios. It proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed differential entropy-based metric (IDEM) provides a robust alternative to traditional Euclidean distance metrics for point cloud registration, addressing key limitations and performing well in challenging real-world scenarios with imperfect data.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

*Jeremiah Coholich,Justin Wit,Robert Azarcon,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANGO is an unpaired image translation method for sim2real transfer that maintains viewpoint consistency, enabling robot policies to handle diverse camera viewpoints using only small real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based robot policies are brittle to camera viewpoint variations, and real robot demonstration data is scarce with limited viewpoint diversity. Simulation can provide comprehensive viewpoint coverage but faces visual sim2real challenges.

Method: Unpaired image translation with novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, highly-regularized discriminator design, and modified PatchNCE loss to maintain viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation.

Result: MANGO outperforms other image translation methods, and policies trained on MANGO-augmented data achieve 60% success rates on views where non-augmented policies completely fail.

Conclusion: MANGO effectively bridges the sim2real gap for viewpoint variations, enabling robust robot manipulation policies using only small real-world datasets while leveraging simulation's viewpoint diversity.

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

### [70] [GRCF: Two-Stage Groupwise Ranking and Calibration Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09606)
*Manning Gao,Leheng Zhang,Shiqin Han,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GRCF, a two-stage framework for multimodal sentiment analysis that combines adaptive pairwise ranking with score calibration to address limitations of existing regression and ordinal learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: point-wise regression is sensitive to label noise and ignores relative ordering, while pairwise ordinal learning treats all comparisons equally and uses static margins that don't reflect varying semantic distances between sentiment groups.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build fine-grained ordinal structure with adaptive focus on hard samples. Stage 2 employs MAE-driven objective for absolute score calibration. Also extended to classification tasks like humor and sarcasm detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks and shows strong generalizability in classification tasks including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: GRCF effectively addresses trade-offs in existing approaches by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples, demonstrating both strong performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

TL;DR: CogRail benchmark for railway intrusion perception with cognitive QA annotations; current VLMs struggle with spatio-temporal reasoning; proposed joint fine-tuning framework improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing railway intrusion systems focus narrowly on object classification and use rule-based heuristics, overlooking latent intrusion risks that require understanding spatial context and temporal dynamics.

Method: 1) Introduce CogRail benchmark with curated datasets and cognitively-driven QA annotations for spatio-temporal reasoning; 2) Systematically evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs; 3) Propose joint fine-tuning framework integrating position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis tasks.

Result: Current large-scale multimodal models struggle with complex spatial-temporal reasoning for cognitive intrusion perception. The proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands.

Conclusion: Structured multi-task learning through joint fine-tuning improves both accuracy and interpretability for railway intrusion perception, highlighting the limitations of existing foundation models in safety-critical domains requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I model anonymity in voting-based leaderboards can be broken using image embedding clustering, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose security flaws in text-to-image model leaderboards where anonymity is assumed for fair comparison, but can actually be broken through systematic analysis.

Method: Centroid-based deanonymization using image embeddings from 22 T2I models and 280 prompts (150K images), analyzing clustering patterns and introducing prompt-level distinguishability metrics.

Result: High accuracy in model identification, revealing systematic model-specific signatures in embedding space, with certain prompts enabling near-perfect distinguishability between models.

Conclusion: Current T2I leaderboard anonymity is fundamentally flawed and vulnerable to deanonymization attacks, necessitating stronger anonymization defenses for fair model comparison.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

TL;DR: A feed-forward framework that estimates simulation-ready garments from single images by predicting material composition and fabric attributes, then mapping them to physical parameters using material-physics measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image garment estimation is challenging due to lack of image-to-physics datasets and ill-posed nature. Existing methods require multi-view capture or only predict geometry without material properties needed for realistic simulation.

Method: 1) Fine-tune vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images. 2) Train lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to physical fabric parameters using small dataset of material-physics measurements. Introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P).

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction. When passed through physics parameter estimator, produces higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

Conclusion: Proposed framework delivers simulation-ready garments from single images without iterative optimization, overcoming limitations of prior methods by combining vision-language models with material-physics mapping.

Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteEmbed is a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that adds new classes without retraining encoders, using subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings with PCA decomposition for coarse semantic alignment and fine-grained separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with rare, emerging, or culturally specific classes that were underrepresented during pretraining, creating a need for efficient personalization methods that can adapt to new categories without full retraining.

Method: LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings using PCA decomposition to disentangle coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. It employs two objectives: coarse alignment for global semantic consistency and fine separation for discriminability among visually similar classes.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks.

Conclusion: LiteEmbed provides a lightweight, plug-and-play framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables seamless adaptation to new classes while maintaining strong performance across multiple vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A highly efficient self-supervised method for animal identification that reframes the problem as global clustering rather than sequential tracking, achieving >97% accuracy with minimal GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional animal identification methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long video sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation.

Method: Reframes animal identification as a global clustering task assuming a known, fixed number of individuals. Uses bounding box detections and total count, samples frame pairs, employs frozen pre-trained backbone with self-bootstrapping mechanism using Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, and adapts Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (>97%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch (order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods). Matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames on challenging datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos).

Conclusion: Enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular visual SLAM suffers from scale drift - gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods accumulate scale drift due to lack of global constraints among independent windows, limiting their accuracy in large-scale scenes.

Method: Proposes SCE-SLAM with two key modules: 1) Geometry-guided aggregation that uses 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and 2) Scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from learned scene coordinate embeddings (patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under canonical scale reference).

Result: Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI show substantial improvements: reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: SCE-SLAM effectively addresses scale drift in monocular visual SLAM through scene coordinate embeddings, enabling scale-consistent 3D reconstruction and navigation while maintaining real-time performance suitable for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences.

To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings.

TL;DR: STEP3-VL-10B is a 10B parameter open-source multimodal model that achieves frontier-level performance rivaling models 10-20x larger through unified pre-training on 1.2T tokens and scaled reinforcement learning post-training.


<details>

Motivation: To redefine the trade-off between model compactness and multimodal intelligence, creating an efficient yet powerful open-source foundation model that can compete with much larger proprietary models.

Conclusion: STEP3-VL-10B delivers best-in-class performance with compact efficiency, providing the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline through full model release.

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generation models are computationally inefficient (minutes of GPU time for seconds of video), creating barriers for real-time applications like embodied AI and VR/AR. There's a need for more efficient video synthesis methods.

Method: 1) Use diffusion models to generate sparse keyframes; 2) Lift keyframes into 3D representation; 3) Render intermediate views for full video; 4) Adaptive keyframe selection model that predicts optimal number of keyframes based on camera trajectory complexity.

Result: SRENDER achieves over 40x speedup compared to diffusion baselines for generating 20-second videos while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability. It adaptively uses sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex motion.

Conclusion: The 3D reconstruction and rendering approach amortizes generation costs across frames while ensuring geometric consistency, providing a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis for real-time applications.

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

*Tony Danjun Wang,Tolga Birdal,Nassir Navab,Lennart Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPOSE formulates multi-view 3D pose estimation as hypergraph partitioning instead of pairwise associations, using geometric pruning for efficiency, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D pose estimation methods rely on brittle pairwise associations that propagate errors when reconciling cycle consistency constraints across multiple views, especially with spurious associations.

Method: COMPOSE formulates multi-view pose correspondence as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than pairwise association, using an efficient geometric pruning strategy to reduce the exponential search space of the integer linear program.

Result: COMPOSE achieves up to 23% improvement in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% improvement over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods.

Conclusion: COMPOSE offers a promising solution to multi-view 3D pose estimation by treating correspondence as hypergraph partitioning with geometric pruning, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

*Ruiqi Shen,Chang Liu,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3-DMS improves video segmentation by using decoupled memory selection for individual objects instead of synchronized group decisions, enhancing multi-object tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original SAM3's group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios because it uses synchronized decisions based on average performance across all targets, often overlooking individual reliability.

Method: Proposes SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects rather than synchronized group decisions.

Result: Achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability, with advantages becoming more pronounced as target density increases.

Conclusion: Establishes a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild by addressing the limitations of SAM3's original memory selection approach.

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: Existing reasoning VLAs with explicit chain-of-thought suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces, creating a need for more efficient reasoning that maintains strong performance in complex VLA tasks.

Method: Uses verbalizable latent reasoning to achieve compact planning, learns efficient reasoning with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher model, and employs preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories for transferring linguistic and visual planning capabilities.

Result: Achieves strong performance with up to 89.3% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fast-ThinkAct enables efficient reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution, addressing the latency-performance trade-off in reasoning VLAs for embodied control tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.
