*Shijing Wang,Chaoqun Cui,Yaping Huang,Hyung Jin Chang,Yihua Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL4Gaze is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating and training vision-language models on gaze understanding, containing 489K QA pairs across 124K images with four complementary tasks, showing that current VLMs struggle with gaze interpretation without targeted supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human gaze provides essential cues for attention, intention, and social interaction interpretation, but gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models. There's no existing benchmark to systematically evaluate or train VLMs for gaze interpretation, leaving it unknown whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training.

Method: Introduces VL4Gaze benchmark with 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images, formulating gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. Evaluates commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings.

Result: Large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. Training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs.

Conclusion: Targeted multi-task supervision is crucial for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs, as general-purpose pre-training alone is insufficient. The VL4Gaze benchmark provides necessary resources for advancing research in this direction, with dataset and code to be released.

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

*Tony Tran,Bin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TrashDets, a family of efficient trash detection models for TinyML devices using hardware-aware neural architecture search, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency over existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for efficient trash detection models that can run on resource-constrained edge and IoT devices under strict TinyML constraints, as existing detectors are often too computationally expensive for such hardware.

Method: The authors develop an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework that constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs evolutionary search alternating between backbone and neck/head optimization, using population passthrough and accuracy predictors to reduce search costs.

Result: TrashDet-l achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters on TACO dataset, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors. On MAX78002 microcontroller, specialized variants reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% while improving mAP50 by 10.2%.

Conclusion: The proposed TrashDets framework successfully creates scalable, deployment-ready trash detectors for TinyML devices, offering a range of model sizes (1.2M to 30.5M parameters) that significantly outperform existing solutions in both accuracy and efficiency metrics.

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

*Markus Gross,Sai B. Matha,Aya Fahmy,Rui Song,Daniel Cremers,Henri Meess*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First real-world camera-based aerial Semantic Scene Completion benchmark (OccuFly) for 3D scene understanding from UAV viewpoints, with automated LiDAR-free annotation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSC is important for 3D perception in robotics but has been largely unexplored in aerial scenarios. LiDAR sensors are problematic for UAVs due to regulations, weight constraints, and sparse point clouds from elevated viewpoints. Most UAVs use cameras, creating a need for camera-based aerial SSC solutions.

Method: Introduces OccuFly benchmark captured at 50m, 40m, 30m altitudes across four seasons, covering urban/industrial/rural areas with 22 semantic classes. Proposes LiDAR-free data generation framework using traditional 3D reconstruction from cameras, automating label transfer by lifting annotated 2D masks into reconstructed point clouds to minimize manual 3D annotation.

Result: Created first real-world camera-based aerial SSC benchmark with comprehensive seasonal and altitude coverage. Developed automated annotation framework that reduces manual labeling effort. Benchmarked state-of-the-art methods on OccuFly and identified challenges specific to elevated viewpoints.

Conclusion: OccuFly enables research on holistic aerial 3D scene understanding without LiDAR dependency, addressing a critical gap in UAV perception. The benchmark and automated annotation framework facilitate progress in camera-based aerial SSC for mobile robotics applications.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NullBUS is a multimodal mixed-supervision framework for breast ultrasound segmentation that handles missing text prompts using nullable prompts and learnable null embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many public breast ultrasound datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, which constrains training to small multimodal subsets and reduces robustness of promptable segmentation methods that require text or spatial prompts.

Method: Proposes NullBUS framework with nullable prompts implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent while still utilizing text when available, all within a single model.

Result: Achieves mean IoU of 0.8568 and mean Dice of 0.9103 on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

Conclusion: NullBUS effectively addresses the challenge of missing metadata in public BUS datasets by enabling mixed-supervision learning, improving segmentation performance and robustness when text prompts are not consistently available.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

### [5] [Learning to Sense for Driving: Joint Optics-Sensor-Model Co-Design for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20815)
*Reeshad Khan amd John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end RAW-to-task co-design framework unifies optics, sensor modeling, and segmentation networks, improving perception performance while maintaining edge deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines separate camera design from perception, discarding information during processing and forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts, which limits performance.

Method: Task-driven co-design framework integrating realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, quantization, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline.

Result: Consistent mIoU improvements on KITTI-360, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes; optics modeling and CFA learning provide largest gains; compact ~1M-parameter model runs at ~28 FPS.

Conclusion: Full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks is a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

*Vidit Agrawal,John Peters,Tyler N. Thompson,Mohammad Vali Sanian,Chau Pham,Nikita Moshkov,Arshad Kazi,Aditya Pillai,Jack Freeman,Byunguk Kang,Samouil L. Farhi,Ernest Fraenkel,Ron Stewart,Lassi Paavolainen,Bryan A. Plummer,Juan C. Caicedo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAMMI-75 is a diverse, open-access dataset of multi-channel microscopy images from 75 biological studies, enabling development of channel-adaptive cellular morphology models that work across different microscopy types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cellular morphology models are specialized for single microscopy imaging types, limiting their reusability across studies due to technical mismatches (different channel numbers) or out-of-distribution experimental conditions.

Method: Created CHAMMI-75 dataset by curating heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies from publicly available sources, enabling investigation of channel-adaptive models.

Result: Training with CHAMMI-75 improves performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks due to its high diversity in microscopy modalities, demonstrating the value of heterogeneous training data.

Conclusion: CHAMMI-75 paves the way for next-generation cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type, enhancing reusability across biological studies.

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

### [7] [Input-Adaptive Visual Preprocessing for Efficient Fast Vision-Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20839)
*Putu Indah Githa Cahyani,Komang David Dananjaya Suartana,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content to reduce redundancy in VLMs, achieving over 50% faster inference and 55% fewer visual tokens without modifying model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have high inference latency and computational costs, especially with high-resolution inputs. Existing pipelines use static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for simple images.

Method: Adaptive visual preprocessing combining content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping. Integrated with FastVLM without architecture changes or retraining.

Result: Over 50% reduction in per-image inference time, lower mean full generation time, and consistent >55% reduction in visual token count compared to baseline on DocVQA subset.

Conclusion: Input-aware preprocessing is an effective lightweight strategy for improving deployment efficiency of VLMs, demonstrated through significant speedups and token reduction without model modifications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALIVE is a local AI system that transforms passive lecture videos into interactive learning experiences using avatar-delivered lectures, content-aware retrieval, and real-time multimodal interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lecture videos lack real-time clarification mechanisms, forcing learners to search externally when confused. Existing interactive systems lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar explanations in a privacy-preserving way.

Method: ALIVE operates fully on local hardware with three components: (1) Avatar-delivered lectures using ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) Content-aware retrieval combining semantic similarity with timestamp alignment; (3) Real-time multimodal interaction allowing pause, text/voice questions, and avatar/text responses.

Result: Demonstrated on a medical imaging course with evaluation showing accurate retrieval, low latency, and positive user experience. The system provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.

Conclusion: ALIVE shows how multimodal AI combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment can significantly enhance recorded lectures' pedagogical value, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

*Haotian Lv,Chao Li,Jiangbo Dai,Yuhui Zhang,Zepeng Fan,Yiqiu Tan,Dawei Wang,Binglei Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes 3D GPR pipeline detection framework with multi-view fusion, DCO-YOLO for small targets, and 3D-DIoU matching, achieving 96.7% mAP in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy for small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios for underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR.

Method: 1) B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis with FDTD simulation validation; 2) DCO-YOLO framework integrating DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention into YOLOv11; 3) 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching with geometric constraints; 4) Three-view fusion strategy.

Result: Achieves 96.2% accuracy, 93.3% recall, and 96.7% mAP in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, outperforming baseline by 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% respectively. Ablation experiments validate synergistic optimization.

Conclusion: Integrates deep learning optimization with 3D GPR physical characteristics, providing efficient and reliable framework for intelligent underground pipeline recognition and localization.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

### [10] [NeRV360: Neural Representation for 360-Degree Videos with a Viewport Decoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20871)
*Daichi Arai,Kyohei Unno,Yasuko Sugito,Yuichi Kusakabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV360: An end-to-end framework for efficient 360° video compression using implicit neural representations that decodes only user-selected viewports instead of entire panoramic frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRV methods for 360° videos suffer from high memory usage and slow decoding speeds, making real-time applications impractical for high-resolution content.

Method: NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction directly into the decoding process and uses a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time.

Result: On 6K-resolution videos, achieves 7x reduction in memory consumption and 2.5x increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, with better image quality in objective metrics.

Conclusion: NeRV360 enables practical real-time applications for high-resolution 360° videos by efficiently decoding only the necessary viewport content rather than entire frames.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

### [11] [Beyond Weight Adaptation: Feature-Space Domain Injection for Cross-Modal Ship Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20892)
*Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Zhelin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Domain Representation Injection (DRI), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for cross-modality ship re-identification that injects domain-specific representations into frozen vision foundation models without modifying pre-trained weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modality ship re-ID suffers from significant modality discrepancies, and existing methods require large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. Vision foundation models have potential to bridge modality gaps, but current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods perform suboptimally on limited-capacity models.

Method: DRI shifts optimization to feature space: keeps VFM fully frozen, uses lightweight Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations, adaptively transforms them via Modulator guided by contextual information, and injects them into intermediate layers via additive fusion to reshape feature distribution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal trainable parameters: 57.9% and 60.5% mAP on HOSS-ReID dataset using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters respectively.

Conclusion: DRI effectively bridges modality gaps in cross-modality ship re-ID by leveraging vision foundation models while preserving general knowledge through frozen weights, achieving superior performance with parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

TL;DR: Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network (DGSAN) improves pulmonary nodule classification by effectively fusing multimodal and multi-temporal data using graph-based attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, and early detection of pulmonary nodules is crucial for improving survival rates. Current multimodal fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, creating a need for more effective multimodal information fusion approaches.

Method: Proposes DGSAN with: 1) Global-Local Feature Encoder to capture local, global, and fused nodule characteristics; 2) Dual-Graph Construction organizing multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs; 3) Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module for refined feature integration; 4) Novel NLST-cmst multimodal dataset compilation.

Result: Extensive experiments on NLST-cmst and CSTL-derived datasets show DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in pulmonary nodule classification with exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DGSAN framework effectively addresses limitations of current multimodal fusion methods and demonstrates superior performance in pulmonary nodule classification, potentially contributing to improved early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights for bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images, demonstrating that a single adaptor can significantly improve VLM performance across diverse compression settings, addressing a critical need for efficient image processing in VLM applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoGrounder: A generalizable 3D visual grounding framework that uses panoramic renderings with 3D features as intermediate representation, leveraging pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning in 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised 3D visual grounding models have limited generalization due to scarce 3D vision-language datasets and weaker reasoning capabilities compared to modern 2D VLMs. There's a need to bridge 2D VLMs' strong language understanding with 3D scene reasoning.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Places compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering scene layout/geometry, 2) Grounds text query on each panoramic rendering using pretrained 2D VLM, 3) Fuses per-view predictions into single 3D bounding box via lifting. Uses panoramic renderings augmented with 3D semantic/geometric features as intermediate representation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks. Demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

Conclusion: PanoGrounder effectively bridges 2D VLMs with 3D reasoning through panoramic representations, achieving strong performance and generalization in 3D visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

TL;DR: SMC-Mamba: A self-supervised Mamba-based framework for general image fusion that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple fusion tasks and downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image fusion needs to handle diverse tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity, unlike task-specific methods that focus only on inter-modal information consolidation.

Method: Proposes SMC-Mamba framework with: 1) Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module using adaptive gating and spatial-channel/frequency-rotational scanning; 2) Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module for dynamic expert collaboration and cross-modal feature interaction; 3) Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL) for preserving high-frequency information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art image fusion algorithms in infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion tasks, as well as downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: SMC-Mamba effectively addresses general image fusion challenges by combining modality-agnostic feature enhancement, multiplex consensus mechanisms, and self-supervised learning to achieve superior performance across diverse fusion applications.

Abstract: Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Render enables efficient high-dimensional feature rendering for 3D open-vocabulary segmentation by sparsely sampling dominant Gaussians, achieving ~43.7x speedup with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D open-vocabulary segmentation methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting suffer from inefficient rendering of high-dimensional features, often requiring codebooks or compression that cause information loss and degrade segmentation quality.

Method: Introduces Quantile Rendering (Q-Render) that sparsely samples only dominant Gaussians along each ray instead of all intersecting ones. Also proposes Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net) - a generalizable 3D neural network that predicts Gaussian features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ScanNet and LeRF benchmarks, enables real-time rendering with ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps while maintaining high fidelity.

Conclusion: Q-Render effectively addresses the efficiency bottleneck in high-dimensional feature rendering for 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, achieving both superior performance and real-time capability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: TVP introduces a transductive visual programming framework that learns reusable tools from experience rather than speculating, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual programming methods for spatial reasoning rely on fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before problem-solving, leading to suboptimal programs and poor tool utilization.

Method: TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library.

Result: On Omni3D-Bench, TVP outperforms GPT-4o by 22% and previous best visual programming by 11%. Learned tools are used 5x more frequently than inductive ones and generalize well to unseen spatial tasks.

Conclusion: Experience-driven transductive tool creation establishes a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Amodal completion framework using multi-agent reasoning with semantic planning before visual synthesis, featuring self-correcting verification and diverse hypothesis generation, plus a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior progressive approaches for amodal completion (inferring invisible object parts) suffer from inference instability and error accumulation, making it challenging to maintain semantic consistency and structural integrity.

Method: Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis, with specialized agents for upfront reasoning. Includes: (1) self-correcting Verification Agent using Chain-of-Thought reasoning to correct segmentation and identify occluders, and (2) Diverse Hypothesis Generator for multiple plausible semantic interpretations of invisible regions.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. Also introduces MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric validated against human judgment and ground truth.

Conclusion: By explicitly separating semantic planning from visual synthesis and incorporating verification and diverse hypothesis mechanisms, the framework enables visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis for amodal completion, establishing a robust standard for evaluation.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: REM is a new synthetic image detection paradigm that models real image distribution instead of generator artifacts, achieving 7.5% average improvement over SOTA methods and strong generalization on real-world degraded images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors overfit to generator-specific artifacts and are sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative models evolve and images undergo multi-round sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect.

Method: Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM) shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling robust real image distribution. It introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold.

Result: Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves 7.5% average improvement over state-of-the-art methods. It maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: REM provides a new paradigm for synthetic image detection that focuses on modeling real image distribution rather than generator artifacts, enabling robust performance under real-world conditions with chain degradations and evolving generative architectures.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

*Yujin Noh,Inho Jake Park,Chigon Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPOT is a map-guided LLM agent that tracks vehicles through CCTV blind spots without training, using spatial coordinates and beam search to predict where vehicles will reappear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCTV-based tracking systems suffer from blind spots between cameras, causing ID switching and trajectory loss, which reduces reliability of real-time path prediction in multi-camera environments.

Method: Represents road structures and CCTV placement as 2D spatial coordinate documents with chunking for real-time querying. Transforms vehicle positions to world coordinates using relative position and FOV info. Combines map spatial info with vehicle direction, speed, and patterns to perform beam search at intersections to predict next CCTV location after blind spots.

Result: Experimental results in CARLA simulator show SPOT accurately predicts next appearing CCTV in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

Conclusion: SPOT enables reliable vehicle tracking through CCTV blind spots without prior training, improving trajectory continuity and real-time path prediction in multi-camera surveillance systems.

Abstract: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

TL;DR: XGrid-Mapping: A hybrid grid framework combining sparse and dense grids for efficient neural LiDAR mapping, using VDB structure with submap organization and distillation-based alignment for large-scale incremental mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural LiDAR mapping approaches either rely on dense implicit representations that underutilize geometric structure, or use voxel-guided methods that struggle with real-time performance. There's a need for efficient large-scale incremental mapping that leverages both geometric priors and rich scene representation.

Method: Proposes XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework combining: 1) sparse grid for geometric priors and structural guidance, 2) implicit dense grid for rich scene representation, 3) VDB structure with submap-based organization for computational efficiency, 4) distillation-based overlap alignment to ensure consistency across submaps, and 5) dynamic removal module for robustness and sampling efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior mapping quality while overcoming efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: XGrid-Mapping successfully addresses the challenges of neural LiDAR mapping by combining explicit and implicit representations, enabling efficient large-scale incremental mapping with improved quality and real-time performance.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography are diagnostically challenging due to scarcity of rare lesion samples, limiting generative methods' effectiveness and diagnostic precision.

Method: 1) Train diffusion model on abundant normal X-rays; 2) Use pre-trained model to inpaint head lesions in diseased X-rays, preserving tail classes as augmented data; 3) Integrate Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module; 4) Apply Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses data scarcity for rare lung lesions by leveraging normal X-rays and advanced generative techniques, significantly improving diagnostic capabilities for long-tailed pulmonary anomalies.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

TL;DR: PUFM++ is an enhanced flow-matching framework for point cloud upsampling that improves geometric fidelity, robustness to imperfect inputs, and consistency with surface-based tasks through a two-stage flow strategy, adaptive time scheduling, on-manifold constraints, and recurrent interface networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing point cloud upsampling methods by improving three key aspects: geometric fidelity (accuracy of reconstructed shapes), robustness to imperfect inputs (handling sparse, noisy, partial observations), and consistency with downstream surface-based tasks (ensuring generated points align with underlying surfaces).

Method: PUFM++ uses a two-stage flow-matching strategy: first learns direct straight-path flow from sparse to dense targets, then refines using noise-perturbed samples. It introduces data-driven adaptive time scheduler for efficient sampling, imposes on-manifold constraints during sampling, and incorporates recurrent interface networks (RIN) for hierarchical feature interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show PUFM++ sets new state-of-the-art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

Conclusion: PUFM++ demonstrates strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling through enhanced flow-matching techniques, achieving improved reconstruction quality, robustness, and surface consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: A feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that predicts scene properties from RGB image sequences using cross-view attention, with consistency-based finetuning for real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view inverse rendering methods ignore cross-view relationships, causing inconsistencies, while multi-view optimization methods are computationally expensive and slow. There's also a generalization gap between synthetic training data and real-world scenes.

Method: A feed-forward framework using alternating attention across views to capture intra-view lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency. Includes consistency-based finetuning using unlabeled real-world videos to improve generalization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-view consistency, material/normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables coherent scene-level reasoning in a single forward pass while maintaining computational efficiency and real-world robustness through consistency-based finetuning.

Abstract: Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality.

Method: Proposes NExT-Vid with two key components: 1) context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and 2) conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Uses masked next-frame prediction for joint image-video modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models show NExT-Vid consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification tasks.

Conclusion: NExT-Vid successfully addresses limitations of existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods and demonstrates superior performance in visual representation learning through its novel architecture combining context isolation and flow-matching techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and overfit with limited data or distribution shifts. Existing mask-based augmentation methods lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantic information.

Method: Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM) uses Granular-ball Computing (GBC) to guide a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process. It adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, demonstrating effectiveness and broad applicability.

Conclusion: GBGM provides a simple, model-agnostic structure-aware data augmentation paradigm that integrates seamlessly with CNNs and Vision Transformers, enhancing model robustness without discarding essential semantics.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FluencyVE is a one-shot video editing method that replaces temporal attention layers in diffusion models with Mamba modules to improve temporal consistency while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods using text-to-image diffusion models suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads when extended to video tasks.

Method: Integrates Mamba (linear time-series module) into Stable Diffusion-based video editing models to replace temporal attention layers, uses low-rank approximation for query/key weight matrices, and employs weighted averaging during training to update attention scores.

Result: Demonstrates promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos while maintaining temporal consistency and reducing computational burden.

Conclusion: FluencyVE provides a simple yet effective approach for one-shot video editing that preserves generative power while addressing temporal inconsistency and computational efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

TL;DR: A novel video defense framework that protects portrait videos against 3D-field talking face generation attacks by perturbing 3D information acquisition while maintaining video quality, achieving 47x speedup over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-field talking face generation methods can synthesize realistic talking face videos from reference portraits, raising serious privacy concerns about malicious misuse. Existing image-based defenses are computationally expensive, degrade video quality, and fail to disrupt 3D information needed for effective video protection.

Method: Proposes an efficient video defense framework with two key components: (1) similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations that disrupt 3D information acquisition.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong defense capability, achieves 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high video fidelity, remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, with effectiveness validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed video defense framework effectively protects portrait videos against 3D-field talking face generation methods by perturbing 3D information acquisition, offering an efficient and high-fidelity solution to address privacy concerns in this emerging threat domain.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

*Mingshu Cai,Osamu Yoshie,Yuya Ieiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A latent diffusion model for infrared-to-visible face conversion with multi-attribute classifier and Self-attn Mamba module achieves SOTA performance in HFR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facial recognition models trained on visible light datasets perform poorly on infrared images due to domain shift. Existing HFR methods suffer from distortion and feature loss during infrared-to-visible conversion.

Method: Latent diffusion-based model for high-quality visible face generation from thermal inputs, with multi-attribute classifier to preserve identity features, and Self-attn Mamba module for global cross-modal feature modeling and faster inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets in both image quality and identity preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses domain shift and feature loss challenges in heterogeneous face recognition, enabling better infrared face recognition through high-quality visible image generation.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSP introduces a novel self-supervised denoising paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation by training BSN on low-resolution decorrelated inputs to predict high-resolution targets, also enabling super-resolution without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off in self-supervised real-world image denoising between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details, which existing blind-spot network methods struggle with due to limitations of pixel-shuffle downsampling.

Method: Next-Scale Prediction (NSP) constructs cross-scale training pairs where blind-spot networks take low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details, effectively separating noise decorrelation from detail preservation.

Result: NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks and significantly alleviates the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation, while naturally supporting super-resolution of noisy images without retraining.

Conclusion: NSP provides an effective solution to the fundamental trade-off in self-supervised denoising by decoupling noise decorrelation from detail preservation through cross-scale prediction, offering both superior denoising performance and additional super-resolution capability.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nuclear norm, commonly used as a convex surrogate for rank minimization in LRMC, suffers from excessive shrinkage of singular values leading to suboptimal solutions. There's a need for better approximations to the rank function.

Method: Introduces a reweighted logarithmic norm as a nonconvex surrogate that provides closer approximation to the rank function than existing alternatives. Uses alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem.

Conclusion: The proposed reweighted logarithmic norm is an effective nonconvex surrogate for rank minimization that outperforms existing LRMC methods, particularly for applications like image inpainting.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: Event camera-based 6DoF object pose tracking using optical flow-guided 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction and iterative optimization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras struggle with motion blur, noise, occlusion, and lighting changes in object pose tracking. Event cameras offer high dynamic range and low latency advantages to overcome these challenges.

Method: 1) 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction detects corners and edges from events and object models. 2) Optical flow of corners is found by maximizing event-associated probability in spatio-temporal windows. 3) Corner-edge correlations established via optical flow guidance. 4) 6DoF pose optimized iteratively by minimizing corner-edge distances.

Result: Outperforms event-based state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness on simulated and real event data.

Conclusion: The optical flow-guided approach effectively leverages event camera advantages for robust 6DoF object pose tracking, addressing limitations of traditional camera-based methods.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: DexAvatar is a framework that reconstructs accurate 3D hand and body poses from monocular sign language videos using learned priors, addressing limitations in current 3D pose estimation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sign language generation relies on data-driven methods needing precise 3D pose data, but most datasets only have 2D keypoints from videos. Existing 3D pose estimation methods for sign language videos suffer from self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur issues, resulting in poor reconstruction quality.

Method: DexAvatar uses learned 3D hand and body priors to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos.

Result: Achieves 35.11% improvement in body and hand pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art on the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only available benchmark for this task.

Conclusion: DexAvatar provides a novel solution for accurate 3D pose reconstruction from sign language videos, addressing critical limitations in current methods and enabling better sign language generation systems.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: UniPath is a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that uses diagnostic understanding for controllable generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 51% better Patho-FID than second-best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology AI has a gap: understanding models are diagnostically competent while generative models only simulate pixels. Three key problems hinder progress: 1) scarcity of large, high-quality image-text datasets, 2) lack of fine-grained semantic control forcing reliance on non-semantic cues, and 3) terminological heterogeneity where different phrasings for the same concept impede reliable text conditioning.

Method: UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: 1) Raw-Text stream, 2) High-Level Semantics stream using learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles, and 3) Prototype stream for component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. The authors also curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a 68K finely annotated subset.

Result: UniPath achieves state-of-the-art performance with Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of real-image quality. The framework demonstrates superior controllable generation capabilities in pathology.

Conclusion: UniPath bridges the gap between understanding and generation in computational pathology by leveraging diagnostic semantics for controllable image generation. The framework addresses key data and control challenges, setting new benchmarks and providing open resources (datasets, code, and model weights) to advance the field.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal action understanding methods face a dilemma: late fusion approaches have computational overhead, while early fusion with shared backbones struggles to achieve excellent performance. There's a need to balance efficiency and effectiveness in multimodal learning.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised framework with two strategies: 1) Decomposition - meticulously decomposes fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features and aligns them with ground truth unimodal counterparts; 2) Composition - integrates multiple unimodal features and uses them as self-supervised guidance to enhance multimodal representation learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the method achieves an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Decomposition and Composition framework successfully addresses the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning through self-supervised strategies that leverage both unimodal and multimodal feature interactions.

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

Conclusion: The work successfully introduces first effective multi-view VPR architecture, showing advantages of integrating 2D/3D features and geometry-grounded tokens for improved place recognition with better generalization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

Motivation: Extracting diverse knowledge from documents is challenging, and existing table recognition models have unexplained effectiveness and slow inference times despite good performance.

Method: Proposes a multi-task model with non-causal attention to capture entire table structure and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content recognition.

Result: Demonstrates superiority both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses both effectiveness and efficiency issues in table recognition, offering improved performance with faster inference.

Abstract: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass serves as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation, revealing significant improvement room for future models and highlighting the value of comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for unified text and formula recognition are large and computationally demanding, limiting their practical applications. There's a need for a lightweight yet effective model that can handle both text and formulas across different document hierarchies.

Method: 1) Created UniRec40M dataset with 40M text, formula, and mixed samples; 2) Developed hierarchical supervision training to handle structural variability; 3) Designed semantic-decoupled tokenizer to separate text and formula representations; 4) Built comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese/English documents across domains and levels.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight unified recognition model successfully addresses computational efficiency challenges while maintaining strong performance across multiple document levels and languages, enabling practical deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

*Chao Gong,Dong Li,Yingwei Pan,Jingjing Chen,Ting Yao,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInpaint: A tuning-free approach that optimizes diffusion latents during inference to improve text-guided image inpainting by enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image inpainting methods struggle to simultaneously maintain both prompt alignment (faithfulness to user text) and visual rationality (visual fidelity) when generating content in specified image regions.

Method: 1) Prior-guided noise optimization that steers model attention to valid inpainting regions by optimizing initial noise. 2) Composite guidance objective tailored for inpainting that directs the denoising process by optimizing intermediate latents at each step.

Result: Extensive experiments with various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FreeInpaint in improving prompt alignment and visual rationality.

Conclusion: FreeInpaint provides a plug-and-play, tuning-free approach that directly optimizes diffusion latents during inference to achieve better text-guided image inpainting results without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with marine domain expertise despite general-purpose capabilities; MarineEval benchmark reveals significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs show promise as general-purpose assistants, their effectiveness in specialized domains like marine science remains unexplored. Marine questions require significant domain expertise and address unique challenges that may exceed current VLM capabilities.

Method: Constructed MarineEval, the first large-scale marine VLM dataset with 2,000 image-based QA pairs covering 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. Domain requirements were integrated into data construction and verified by marine experts. Benchmarked 17 existing VLMs on this dataset.

Result: Experimental results show existing VLMs cannot effectively answer domain-specific marine questions, revealing significant performance gaps and substantial room for improvement in specialized domain expertise.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack sufficient marine domain expertise despite their general-purpose capabilities. The MarineEval benchmark provides a foundation for future research to improve VLM performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC-Net is a CLIP-based framework for text-guided medical segmentation that addresses CLIP's limitations in medical imaging through parameter-efficient adaptations, achieving SOTA performance with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided medical segmentation methods use unaligned image/text encoders requiring complex fusion modules. While CLIP offers pre-aligned multimodal features, it has three key limitations for medical imaging: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment.

Method: TGC-Net introduces three components: 1) Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, 2) Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and 3) Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

Result: Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: TGC-Net effectively addresses CLIP's limitations for medical segmentation through parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations, providing a superior framework for text-guided medical segmentation with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Marine visual understanding is essential for monitoring and protecting marine ecosystems, enabling automatic and scalable biological surveys. However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species.

### [45] [A Turn Toward Better Alignment: Few-Shot Generative Adaptation with Equivariant Feature Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21174)
*Chenghao Xu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EFR (Equivariant Feature Rotation) is a novel few-shot image generation method that aligns source and target domains in a self-rotated proxy feature space using learnable rotation matrices from a parameterized Lie Group, overcoming limitations of strict consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot image generation methods use consistency constraints (instance-level or distribution-level) to align source and target domains, but these often fail: strict constraints amplify domain gap effects causing distorted content, while relaxed constraints fail to effectively leverage source domain knowledge. The fundamental issue is the discrepancy in distribution structures between domains, compounded by limited target samples preventing accurate target distribution estimation.

Method: Proposes Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR) that aligns domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Uses adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space where alignment occurs. Learnable rotation matrices bridge domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion while facilitating knowledge transfer.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various commonly used datasets demonstrate that the method significantly enhances generative performance within the targeted domain compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: EFR effectively addresses the limitations of traditional consistency constraints in few-shot image generation by introducing a novel alignment strategy in an equivariant proxy feature space, enabling better knowledge transfer from source to target domains while preserving structural information.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain.

TL;DR: NAME is a novel implicit neural representation framework for continuous human motion sequences that enables interpolation, inbetweening, and extrapolation at arbitrary frame rates using hierarchical temporal encoding and parametric Fourier-based activation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher frame rates improve motion smoothness and temporal coherence. Current methods lack the ability to handle motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates with continuous representation capabilities.

Method: Proposes NAME: a parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Uses hierarchical temporal encoding to extract features at multiple temporal scales, and integrates a custom parametric activation function powered by Fourier transformations into an MLP-based decoder.

Result: Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach in representing complex motion behaviors with high accuracy.

Conclusion: The NAME framework successfully enables continuous representation of human motion sequences with interpolation, inbetweening, and extrapolation capabilities at arbitrary frame rates, significantly enhancing motion representation accuracy through hierarchical temporal encoding and parametric activation functions.

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

TL;DR: UltraShape 1.0 is a scalable 3D diffusion framework that uses a two-stage pipeline (coarse structure generation followed by detail refinement) with improved data processing and decoupled spatial localization for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation that works with limited training resources and publicly available datasets, addressing challenges in geometric quality and detail synthesis.

Method: Two-stage generation pipeline: 1) coarse global structure synthesis, 2) detailed refinement. Includes comprehensive data processing with watertight processing and quality filtering. Decouples spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis using voxel-based refinement with fixed spatial locations and RoPE encoding for positional anchors.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation, despite being trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets with limited resources.

Conclusion: UltraShape 1.0 demonstrates an effective approach for high-quality 3D geometry generation through improved data processing and decoupled refinement strategies, with plans to release all code and models to support future research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

TL;DR: VisRes Bench is a new benchmark that isolates visual reasoning abilities in VLMs without language context, revealing their limitations in perceptual and relational reasoning across three complexity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs show impressive performance but it's unclear whether they truly perform visual reasoning or just rely on linguistic priors. There's a need to isolate and evaluate pure visual reasoning capabilities without language supervision.

Method: Created VisRes Bench with 19,000+ controlled task images across three complexity levels: Level 1 tests perceptual completion and image matching under perturbations; Level 2 tests rule-based inference on single attributes; Level 3 tests compositional reasoning requiring integration of multiple visual attributes.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, showing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. They struggle with pure visual reasoning without language context.

Conclusion: VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research by isolating distinct reasoning abilities and revealing current model limitations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

Motivation: Existing on-body motion estimation methods suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, hindering adoption in daily life applications like XR interaction.

Method: Uses everyday wearables (smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, smart glasses with cameras) with multimodal teacher-student framework integrating visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals. Trained on real-world Ego-Elec dataset rather than synthetic data.

Result: Outperforms baseline models, validating effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation. Eliminates sim-to-real gap that constrained prior work.

Conclusion: EveryWear provides a lightweight, practical motion capture solution using everyday wearables without calibration, enabling robust daily life applications through real-world training and multimodal sensor fusion.

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

TL;DR: Proposes unsupervised visual reasoning tokens for LMMs to handle vision-centric tasks without explicit visual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs are text-centric and struggle with visual reasoning tasks. Existing approaches use supervised visual abstractions (helper images, depth maps, crops) which impose restrictive priors, add annotation costs, and lack generalization.

Method: Task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode images in a task-adaptive way to extract relevant visual information.

Result: Outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse vision-centric tasks, including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify. Also generalizes to multi-task instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised visual reasoning tokens enable LMMs to better handle visual reasoning tasks without hand-crafted supervision, addressing a critical limitation of current text-centric multimodal models.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

Motivation: Real-world image-text retrieval is challenging due to vague/context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and scalability needs. Existing methods struggle with complex real-world scenarios.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on event-centric entity extraction, 2) Deep multimodal semantic reranking using BEiT-3 models to capture temporal and contextual signals.

Result: Achieves mean average precision of 0.559 on OpenEvents v1 benchmark, substantially outperforming prior baselines.

Conclusion: Combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling enables accurate and efficient retrieval in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines.

TL;DR: SegMo: A novel framework for generating 3D human motions from text using segment-level alignment between textual phrases and motion segments for finer-grained correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align text and motion at sequence level, ignoring internal semantic structure. Both motion descriptions and sequences can be decomposed into smaller semantically coherent segments, which could serve as atomic alignment units for finer-grained correspondence.

Method: Three-module framework: (1) Text Segment Extraction - decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases representing atomic actions; (2) Motion Segment Extraction - partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment - aligns text and motion segments using contrastive learning.

Result: Improves strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving TOP 1 score of 0.553 on HumanML3D test set. Learned shared embedding space enables application to retrieval-style tasks like motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

Conclusion: SegMo demonstrates that segment-level alignment between text and motion enables finer-grained correspondence and improves motion generation quality, with additional benefits for retrieval tasks through learned shared embedding space.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-shot filmmaking is aesthetically sophisticated but prohibitively expensive and constrained in reality. Existing video generation models use naive clip concatenation that fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) Lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism in DiT architecture with Adaptive Tuning strategy for robust arbitrary-frame control; (2) High-quality dataset curation with Visual Expression SFT stage and Tailored DPO scheme for motion rationality and transition smoothness; (3) Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy for memory-efficient long sequence generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, enabling transformation of fragmented visual materials into cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

Conclusion: DreaMontage provides a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality, expressive one-shot videos from diverse user inputs, overcoming practical constraints of real-world one-shot filmmaking through advanced video generation techniques.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 7 modality combinations on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks datasets, demonstrating superior generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical anomaly detection under real-world, imperfect modality conditions with clinical applicability.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

### [55] [ACD: Direct Conditional Control for Video Diffusion Models via Attention Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21268)
*Weiqi Li,Zehao Zhang,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACD is a novel video diffusion framework that uses attention supervision for direct conditional control, achieving better alignment with conditioning signals while maintaining temporal coherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conditional video synthesis have limitations: classifier-free guidance provides indirect control with limited alignment, while classifier-based guidance can produce adversarial artifacts when models exploit the classifier without genuinely satisfying conditions.

Method: Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD) uses attention supervision to align model attention maps with external control signals. It introduces sparse 3D-aware object layouts as conditioning, with a Layout ControlNet and automated annotation pipeline for scalable integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

Conclusion: ACD provides a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models through attention supervision, overcoming limitations of existing guidance methods and enabling better controllability with efficient layout conditioning.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

### [56] [GriDiT: Factorized Grid-Based Diffusion for Efficient Long Image Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21276)
*Snehal Singh Tomar,Alexandros Graikos,Arjun Krishna,Dimitris Samaras,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image sequence generation method that factorizes generation into low-resolution sequence modeling followed by individual frame super-resolution, outperforming SoTA in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SoTA methods treat image sequences as large tensors of stacked frames, which leads to inefficiencies and bottlenecks in generation. The authors question whether this straightforward representation is ideal and aim to develop a more effective way to model image sequence data for generative tasks.

Method: The method factorizes generation into two stages: 1) First generates coarse sequences at low resolution using a generative model trained on grid images of subsampled frames, leveraging Diffusion Transformer's self-attention to capture frame correlations, effectively extending a 2D image generator to low-resolution 3D sequence generation without architectural changes; 2) Then super-resolves each frame individually to add sequence-independent high-resolution details.

Result: The method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences compared to existing models. It enables high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences with increased efficiency in inference time (at least twice as fast) and training data usage. It also generalizes effectively across diverse data domains without requiring additional priors or supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed factorization approach overcomes key limitations of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, offering a more effective representation that improves quality, coherence, efficiency, and generalization while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeSurgSeg is a spike-driven video Transformer framework for surgical scene segmentation that achieves comparable accuracy to ANN models while reducing inference latency by 8-20×, enabling real-time deployment on non-GPU platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for surgical scene segmentation have high computational demands that hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. SNNs offer efficiency but face challenges with limited surgical data and sparse video representations.

Method: Proposes SpikeSurgSeg with: 1) Surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining using layer-wise tube masking for robust spatiotemporal representation learning, and 2) Lightweight spike-driven segmentation head for temporally consistent predictions while maintaining low latency.

Result: Achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least 8×, with over 20× acceleration relative to foundation-model baselines on EndoVis18 and SurgBleed datasets.

Conclusion: SpikeSurgSeg demonstrates the potential of SNNs for time-critical surgical scene segmentation, offering efficient real-time performance on non-GPU platforms while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

### [58] [Post-Processing Mask-Based Table Segmentation for Structural Coordinate Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21287)
*Suren Bandara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel multi-scale signal processing method for table edge detection using Gaussian convolution on table masks to improve robustness in noisy/low-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing table structure extraction methods struggle with noisy/low-resolution images. Transformer-based methods lack adaptability to noise, while mask-based edge detection suffers from noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost when applied directly to images.

Method: Models row/column transitions as 1D signals from table masks, applies Gaussian convolution with increasing variances, uses statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving structural edges, then maps detected signal peaks back to image coordinates for accurate segment boundaries.

Result: Improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) from 67% to 76% on PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. Method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies.

Conclusion: Proposed signal-processing approach effectively detects table edges from masks, offering improved robustness to noise and resolution variations while producing optimized structured tabular outputs for downstream analysis.

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent benchmarks are limited to simple tasks, few applications, and coarse metrics, failing to capture the complexity of real-world mobile automation scenarios that require handling long-latency tasks with multiple steps and constraints.

Method: Created AndroidLens with 571 real-world tasks requiring ~26 steps each, across 38 domains in Chinese/English. Features static evaluation preserving real-world anomalies and allowing multiple valid paths, plus dynamic evaluation with milestone-based progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP).

Result: Even the best models achieve only 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP, revealing significant performance gaps. Key challenges identified include handling environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Conclusion: AndroidLens provides a comprehensive, challenging benchmark that exposes limitations of current GUI agents in real-world mobile automation, highlighting critical research directions for improving agent capabilities in complex, long-latency tasks.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents can substantially improve productivity by automating frequently executed long-latency tasks on mobile devices. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are still constrained to limited applications, simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics. To address this, we introduce AndroidLens, a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents, comprising 571 long-latency tasks in both Chinese and English environments, each requiring an average of more than 26 steps to complete. The framework features: (1) tasks derived from real-world user scenarios across 38 domains, covering complex types such as multi-constraint, multi-goal, and domain-specific tasks; (2) static evaluation that preserves real-world anomalies and allows multiple valid paths to reduce bias; and (3) dynamic evaluation that employs a milestone-based scheme for fine-grained progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP). Our evaluation indicates that even the best models reach only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP. We also underscore key challenges in real-world environments, including environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TICON is a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that enriches tile embeddings with slide-level context, improving performance across computational pathology tasks and enabling a slide-level foundation model with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard tile encoder pipelines extract embeddings without context, failing to capture essential slide-level information needed for both local and global tasks in computational pathology. Different tile encoders excel at different tasks, requiring a unified model to contextualize embeddings from any tile-level foundation model.

Method: TICON uses a single shared transformer encoder pretrained with a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. It processes tiles with their larger image context to produce rich, contextualized embeddings.

Result: TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (Patho-Bench). A slide-level foundation model pretrained on TICON using only 11K WSIs outperforms SoTA models trained with up to 350K WSIs.

Conclusion: TICON successfully addresses the need for contextualized tile representations in computational pathology, providing a unified approach that improves performance across diverse tasks and enables efficient slide-level foundation modeling with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided token pruning framework for SAM2 that improves efficiency by selectively reducing token density before temporal propagation, achieving 42.5% faster inference and 37.4% lower GPU memory usage while maintaining segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's practical deployment is limited by high computational and memory costs from processing all visual tokens across time, regardless of their relevance to target objects, leading to quadratic memory attention overhead and reduced scalability.

Method: A text-guided token pruning framework that operates after visual encoding and before memory-based propagation. It uses a lightweight routing mechanism to rank tokens based on local visual context, semantic relevance from object-centric textual descriptions (user-provided or auto-generated), and uncertainty cues for ambiguous/boundary regions.

Result: Achieves up to 42.50% faster inference and 37.41% lower GPU memory usage compared to unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, highlighting the potential of early token selection to improve scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and quantify the popularity bias in vision-language models where they rely on memorization of famous landmarks rather than developing generalizable understanding of visual concepts.

Method: Created YearGuessr dataset with 55,546 building images from 157 countries, annotated with construction years (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as popularity proxy. Framed construction year prediction as ordinal regression and introduced popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to measure bias.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical flaw in VLM reasoning capabilities - they rely on memorization rather than developing robust, generalizable understanding, exposing limitations in current vision-language model architectures.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiStream is an efficient autoregressive framework for high-resolution video generation that reduces computational redundancy through spatial, temporal, and timestep compression, achieving up to 107.5x faster denoising than baselines with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution video generation is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible due to excessive computational requirements.

Method: HiStream uses three compression strategies: 1) Spatial compression - denoising at low resolution first, then refining at high resolution with cached features; 2) Temporal compression - chunk-by-chunk processing with fixed-size anchor cache for stable inference; 3) Timestep compression - applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent cache-conditioned chunks.

Result: On 1080p benchmarks, HiStream achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with 76.2x faster denoising than Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. HiStream+ (with all three optimizations) achieves 107.5x acceleration, offering compelling speed-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: HiStream makes high-resolution video generation practical and scalable by dramatically reducing computational requirements while maintaining visual quality, addressing the fundamental bottleneck in video diffusion models.

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.
