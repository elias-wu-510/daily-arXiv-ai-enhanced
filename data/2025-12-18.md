### [1] [SkyCap: Bitemporal VHR Optical-SAR Quartets for Amplitude Change Detection and Foundation-Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14755)
*Paul Weinmann,Ferdinand Schenck,Martin Šiklar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkyCap dataset enables optical-to-SAR label transfer for VHR SAR change detection without expert annotations, showing optical foundation models can outperform SAR-specific models with proper preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical VHR imagery has interpretability but cloud interference breaks acquisition cadence, while SAR enables all-weather monitoring but is difficult to annotate. Need reliable high-resolution data for linear infrastructure monitoring.

Method: Created SkyCap dataset by archive matching and co-registration of SkySat (optical) and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. Used optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection labels without SAR-expert annotations. Performed continued pretraining of SARATR-X on SAR data and benchmarked SAR-specific foundation models against optical FMs with different preprocessing.

Result: MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical foundation model with dB+Z-score preprocessing, achieved best performance (F1_c = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained on Capella data. Found strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and optical model rankings don't transfer directly to SAR ACD.

Conclusion: First evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR amplitude change detection shows optical models can perform well with proper preprocessing, challenging assumption that SAR-specific models are always superior. Optical-to-SAR label transfer enables SAR ACD without expert annotations.

Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

### [2] [SocialNav-MoE: A Mixture-of-Experts Vision Language Model for Socially Compliant Navigation with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14757)
*Tomohito Kawabata,Xinyu Zhang,Ling Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SocialNav-MoE: An efficient Mixture-of-Experts VLM for socially compliant robot navigation using reinforcement fine-tuning with semantic similarity rewards, achieving good balance between accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot navigation focuses mainly on safety while neglecting social compliance (human comfort, social norms, contextual appropriateness). Large VLMs are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robots.

Method: Proposes SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). Introduces semantic similarity reward (SSR) to enhance decision-making. Investigates different small language models (Phi, Qwen, StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned).

Result: SocialNav-MoE achieves excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency on SNEI dataset. SSR function proves more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards.

Conclusion: Small VLMs with Mixture-of-Experts architecture and reinforcement fine-tuning can enable socially compliant navigation while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time robotic deployment.

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Fan Bu,Rongfeng Li,Zijin Li,Ya Li,Linfeng Fan,Pei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid expert-system pipeline for optical music recognition of Chinese Jianpu notation that converts printed scores with lyrics to MusicXML/MIDI without requiring large annotated datasets, achieving high accuracy on melody and lyric recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale OMR research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu notation and its rich lyric resources underexplored, creating a need for specialized recognition systems for this musical tradition.

Method: Modular expert-system pipeline using top-down design with traditional computer-vision techniques (phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) combined with unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings, balancing interpretability and accuracy.

Result: Successfully digitized over 5,000 melody-only songs (>300,000 notes) and 1,400+ songs with lyrics (>100,000 notes) from The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, achieving note-wise F1 = 0.951 for melody and character-wise F1 = 0.931 for aligned lyrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid expert-system approach effectively addresses the gap in Chinese Jianpu OMR, providing high-precision recognition without requiring massive annotated training data, enabling large-scale digitization of this important musical tradition.

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

### [4] [AquaDiff: Diffusion-Based Underwater Image Enhancement for Addressing Color Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14760)
*Afrah Shaahid,Muzammil Behzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AquaDiff is a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework that corrects color distortion while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity using chromatic prior-guided color compensation and conditional diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from severe degradation due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, causing color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications.

Method: AquaDiff integrates chromatic prior-guided color compensation with conditional diffusion process using cross-attention to fuse degraded inputs and noisy latent states. It features enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention, plus a novel cross-domain consistency loss enforcing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks show AquaDiff provides good results compared to state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

Conclusion: AquaDiff effectively addresses underwater image degradation challenges through a diffusion-based framework that combines chromatic compensation with advanced attention mechanisms and comprehensive loss functions, demonstrating strong performance in color correction and image quality enhancement.

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

### [5] [Improving VQA Reliability: A Dual-Assessment Approach with Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14770)
*Xixian Wu,Yang Ou,Pengchao Tian,Zian Yang,Jielei Zhang,Peiyi Li,Longwen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVR is a dual-assessment framework that combines self-reflection and cross-model verification to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability in VLM-based visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from hallucinations that produce overconfident but incorrect answers, undermining answer reliability in VQA tasks.

Method: Dual-pathway architecture: one pathway uses dual selector modules to fuse VLM latent features with QA embeddings for self-reflection; the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: Achieved leading Φ₁₀₀ score of 39.64 and 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025.

Conclusion: DAVR effectively enhances VLM trustworthiness through comprehensive uncertainty estimation combining internal self-assessment and external verification.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [6] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERBench is a new VideoQA benchmark designed to test multi-evidence integration across time, requiring aggregation of at least three non-overlapping visual cues from different video segments, revealing significant limitations in current Video-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from single salient cues, under-testing reasoning that requires aggregating multiple, temporally separated visual evidence across time.

Method: Created HERBench with 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into 12 compositional tasks, introduced Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS) metric to quantify evidential demand, and evaluated 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs.

Result: HERBench imposes substantially higher evidential demand (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2 in prior datasets). Current Video-LLMs perform poorly (31-42% accuracy vs 20% random baseline), revealing retrieval and fusion deficits.

Conclusion: HERBench establishes a principled benchmark for advancing robust, compositional video understanding by making cross-time evidence integration both unavoidable and quantifiable, highlighting critical bottlenecks in current Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

### [7] [Isolated Sign Language Recognition with Segmentation and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14876)
*Daniel Perkins,Davis Hunter,Dhrumil Patel,Galen Flanagan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight model for isolated sign language recognition that uses pose estimation, segmentation, and ResNet-Transformer architecture to handle signer variability with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have automated spoken/written language translation but remain inaccessible to ASL users. Current ISLR systems face challenges with scarce data, high signer variability, and high computational costs.

Method: Three-component approach: (1) pose estimation pipeline for hand/face joint coordinates, (2) segmentation module to isolate relevant information, (3) ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

Result: Proposed model reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation (specific metrics not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: The approach bridges the accessibility gap for ASL users by creating a more efficient and robust ISLR system that can handle real-world signer variability with lower computational costs.

Abstract: The recent surge in large language models has automated translations of spoken and written languages. However, these advances remain largely inaccessible to American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose language relies on complex visual cues. Isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) - the task of classifying videos of individual signs - can help bridge this gap but is currently limited by scarce per-sign data, high signer variability, and substantial computational costs. We propose a model for ISLR that reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation. Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

### [8] [Visual-textual Dermatoglyphic Animal Biometrics: A First Case Study on Panthera tigris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14878)
*Wenshuo Li,Majid Mirmehdi,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces dermatoglyphic textual descriptors for animal re-identification, combining visual and textual modalities to improve cross-modal retrieval and address data scarcity through text-image co-synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for animal re-identification are largely image-based and limited to species with distinctive morphological features. The paper aims to extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating forensic-inspired dermatoglyphic textual descriptors to overcome vision-only limitations and improve explainability.

Method: Developed a visual-textual methodology using dermatoglyphic language tags to encode animal coat topology. Created a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals' (dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text) to address data scarcity. Evaluated on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers.

Result: The dermatoglyphic language-guided approach enables novel cross-modal identity retrieval capabilities. Benchmarking shows the augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. The method allows textual-to-visual identity recovery with human-verifiable matchings.

Conclusion: Dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations in animal re-identification, representing a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and enabling language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

### [9] [Vibe Spaces for Creatively Connecting and Expressing Visual Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14884)
*Huzheng Yang,Katherine Xu,Andrew Lu,Michael D. Grossberg,Yutong Bai,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vibe Blending creates visual concept hybrids by finding shared attributes between images, using Vibe Space's hierarchical graph manifold to learn smooth semantic transitions in feature spaces like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths connecting distant concepts in latent space for creating meaningful visual hybrids that reveal shared attributes between images.

Method: Propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts.

Result: Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods, validated through a cognitively inspired evaluation framework.

Conclusion: Vibe Space successfully addresses the challenge of generating coherent visual concept hybrids by learning meaningful semantic transitions in feature spaces, outperforming existing methods in creative quality.

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

### [10] [PANDA-PLUS-Bench: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of AI Foundation Models in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14922)
*Joshua L. Ebbert,Dennis Della Corte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers created PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a specialized benchmark dataset to evaluate AI foundation models for prostate cancer Gleason grading, specifically testing their ability to distinguish biological features from slide-specific artifacts that could inflate validation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI foundation models for prostate cancer Gleason grading may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting their real-world clinical utility. There's a need to quantify this failure mode and evaluate model robustness.

Method: Created PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset with 9 whole slide images from 9 unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns. Extracted non-overlapping tissue patches at 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across 8 augmentation conditions. Evaluated 7 foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders.

Result: Substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 had lowest slide-level encoding (81.0%) but second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder (trained on prostate tissue) showed highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%). All models had within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps ranging from 19.9 to 26.9 percentage points.

Conclusion: PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in Gleason grading. Tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signature recognition. The benchmark enables standardized evaluation of model robustness in this clinically important context.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

*Abhijeet Parida,Daniel Capellán-Martín,Zhifan Jiang,Nishad Kulkarni,Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Syed Muhammad Anwar,María J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive post-processing techniques improve glioma segmentation quality from large-scale pretrained models, addressing systematic errors while being computationally efficient and sustainable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pretrained models for brain tumor segmentation suffer from poor generalization, systematic errors (false positives, label swaps, slice discontinuities), computational resource inequality, and high environmental costs of training.

Method: Proposed adaptive post-processing techniques to refine glioma segmentations from large-scale pretrained models, shifting focus from complex architectures to efficient post-processing strategies.

Result: Demonstrated in BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks: ranking metric improved by 14.9% for sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for adult glioma challenge.

Conclusion: Promotes shift in brain tumor segmentation research from complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

### [12] [TalkVerse: Democratizing Minute-Long Audio-Driven Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14938)
*Zhenzhi Wang,Jian Wang,Ke Ma,Dahua Lin,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TalkVerse is a large-scale open corpus for audio-driven talking video generation with 2.3M high-resolution clips, plus a reproducible 5B DiT baseline model that achieves minute-long generation with low drift and 10× lower inference cost than comparable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven talking video generation systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, making fair comparison difficult. There's a need for open, large-scale datasets and reproducible baselines to advance research in this field.

Method: 1) Created TalkVerse dataset: 2.3M high-res clips from 60k+ hours of video using scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, audio-visual sync checks, and comprehensive annotations. 2) Built 5B DiT baseline on Wan2.2-5B with video VAE (high downsampling ratio) and sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context. 3) Integrated MLLM director for prompt rewriting based on audio/visual cues. 4) Implemented zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection.

Result: The model achieves minute-long generation with low drift, comparable lip-sync and visual quality to 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10× lower inference cost. Supports enhanced storytelling via MLLM director and zero-shot video dubbing.

Conclusion: TalkVerse provides an open, large-scale dataset and reproducible baseline for audio-driven talking video generation, lowering research barriers. The 5B DiT model offers efficient, high-quality generation with advanced features like storytelling enhancement and video dubbing.

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

### [13] [Puzzle Curriculum GRPO for Vision-Centric Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14944)
*Ahmadreza Jeddi,Hakki Can Karaimer,Hue Nguyen,Zhongling Wang,Ke Zhao,Javad Rajabi,Ran Zhang,Raghav Goyal,Babak Taati,Radek Grzeszczuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-GRPO is a supervision-free RL method that uses self-supervised puzzle environments (PatchFit, Rotation, Jigsaw) with verifiable rewards and a difficulty-aware curriculum to improve visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for chain-of-thought reasoning in VLMs have three key issues: reliance on costly/noisy annotations or external verifiers, flat/sparse reward schemes in GRPO, and logical inconsistency between reasoning chains and final answers.

Method: PC-GRPO uses three self-supervised puzzle environments with verifiable rewards: PatchFit and Rotation (binary rewards), and Jigsaw (graded partial credit). It introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty, plus monitors Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training.

Result: PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy across diverse benchmarks on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones. The curriculum delays RAC decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC, which correlates with downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: PC-GRPO offers a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs by eliminating the need for annotations/external verifiers while addressing reward sparsity and logical consistency issues.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A trimodal person identification framework using voice, face, and gesture modalities with cross-attention fusion and confidence-weighted adaptation for missing modalities, achieving near-perfect accuracy on CANDOR and VoxCeleb1 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world person recognition systems often face missing or degraded modalities, requiring robust solutions that can handle incomplete data while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Multi-task learning for independent modality processing, cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms for modality interaction, and confidence-weighted fusion strategy to adapt to missing/low-quality data.

Result: Achieved 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on CANDOR dataset, 99.92% accuracy on VoxCeleb1 in Bimodal mode, and maintained high accuracy even with missing modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed trimodal framework provides a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications by effectively handling modality loss while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

*Maria Bulychev,Neil G. Marchant,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-hoc image watermarking method with localized embedding and region-level interpretability that generates detection maps showing which image regions are watermarked or altered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes without insight into how/where watermarks are present, impacting user trust and making it difficult to interpret tampering effects.

Method: Embeds watermark signals in discrete wavelet transform domain using statistical block-wise strategy, combining localized embedding with region-level interpretability to generate detection maps.

Result: Achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations; watermarks are highly imperceptible and robust to cropping up to half the image.

Conclusion: The method offers more interpretable detection than prior post-hoc methods while retaining competitive robustness, addressing transparency issues in watermarking systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

### [16] [Beyond Proximity: A Keypoint-Trajectory Framework for Classifying Affiliative and Agonistic Social Networks in Dairy Cattle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14998)
*Sibi Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-based computer vision framework that uses anatomical keypoint trajectories to automatically classify social interactions (affiliative vs. agonistic) in livestock, outperforming traditional proximity-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precision livestock farming approaches use static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish between different types of social behaviors (affiliative vs. agonistic), limiting the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial barn environments.

Method: End-to-end computer vision pipeline combining YOLOv11 for object detection, supervised individual identification, ByteTrack for multi-object tracking, ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and an SVM classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics from keypoint trajectories.

Result: The framework achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone, with substantial improvements over proximity-only baselines. The system demonstrated high performance in object detection (96.24% mAP@0.50), individual identification (98.24%), and tracking (81.96%).

Conclusion: The pose-based framework successfully moves beyond simple proximity heuristics by modeling spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints, enabling automated, vision-based inference of social interactions for constructing interaction-aware social networks with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

*Huaying Zhang,Atsushi Hashimoto,Tosho Hirasawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation protocol for video question generation models that focuses on question quality for eliciting expert knowledge, using a question-to-answer retrieval approach with a novel EgoExoAsk dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video question generation (VQG) evaluation focuses on answerability rather than question quality for extracting unseen knowledge from human experts. There's a need for quantitative evaluation of what makes questions effective at eliciting expert information.

Method: Proposes a protocol evaluating VQG models' ability to elicit expert knowledge by simulating question-answering communication using question-to-answer retrieval. Constructs EgoExoAsk dataset (27,666 QA pairs from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary) to train a retriever, then benchmarks on validation set with video segments.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models with richer context receive better evaluations, validating that the protocol works as intended for assessing question quality.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for VQG that focuses on question quality for expert knowledge elicitation, supported by the EgoExoAsk dataset and retrieval-based evaluation protocol that correlates with model capabilities.

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior preference optimization methods in medical image segmentation are model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling, limiting their applicability and effectiveness.

Method: MAPO uses dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. It's architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based pipelines.

Result: MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training across diverse medical datasets.

Conclusion: MAPO provides a scalable, model-agnostic preference optimization framework that improves segmentation performance without requiring direct ground-truth supervision.

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

### [19] [MVGSR: Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Super-Resolution via Epipolar Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15048)
*Kaizhe Zhang,Shinan Chen,Qian Zhao,Weizhan Zhang,Caixia Yan,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVGSR is a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting super-resolution framework that integrates multi-view information to achieve high-frequency details and enhanced consistency for 3DGS rendering from low-resolution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS SR methods have limitations: single-image SR networks lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views, while video-based SR approaches require strictly sequential frames, limiting applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets.

Method: Proposes MVGSR with two key innovations: 1) Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses for arbitrary multi-view datasets without temporal continuity requirements, and 2) Epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism that selectively aggregates consistent information from auxiliary views to enhance geometric consistency and detail fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks, achieving high-frequency details and enhanced consistency in 3DGS representations.

Conclusion: MVGSR effectively bridges LR inputs and HR rendering for 3DGS by integrating multi-view information with novel view selection and attention mechanisms, overcoming limitations of previous approaches and achieving superior SR performance.

Abstract: Scenes reconstructed by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) trained on low-resolution (LR) images are unsuitable for high-resolution (HR) rendering. Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using event cameras with LED markers to measure high-frequency structural deformations, overcoming limitations of traditional high-speed cameras in harsh lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional high-speed camera methods for measuring high-frequency deformations in large-scale structures are limited by harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs.

Method: Uses event camera with LED markers; filters observation noise based on event stream characteristics; differentiates between motion-induced events and LED blinking events; extracts LED markers from event stream; measures high-frequency planar deformations with monocular event camera.

Result: Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

Conclusion: Event cameras with LED markers provide an effective solution for measuring high-frequency structural deformations, overcoming limitations of traditional high-speed camera methods.

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

TL;DR: MWNet: A memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network for high-fidelity segmentation of small objects in medical ultrasound videos, addressing low contrast and noisy background challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ultrasound videos have low contrast and noisy backgrounds causing missegmentation of organ boundaries, small object losses, and boundary errors. Object tracking in long videos is also challenging for computer-assisted surgery workflows.

Method: Proposes MWNet with encoder-decoder structure using memory-based wavelet convolution to capture category/detailed information, cascaded wavelet compression for multiscale frequency fusion, LSTM bank with cross-attention for long video tracking, and HF-aware feature fusion with adaptive wavelet filters.

Result: Demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics on four ultrasound video datasets (thyroid nodule, thyroid gland, heart) compared with SOTA methods, particularly for accurate segmentation of small thyroid nodules.

Conclusion: MWNet effectively addresses small object segmentation in long ultrasound videos by integrating wavelet filtering, memory mechanisms, and frequency-domain feature fusion, showing strong potential for computer-assisted surgery applications.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

TL;DR: Nano Banana Pro shows strong subjective visual quality for low-level vision tasks but underperforms on traditional quantitative metrics compared to specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether commercial text-to-image models like Nano Banana Pro can serve as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision tasks, given their underexplored potential in this domain.

Method: Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 low-level vision tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets using simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, benchmarking against state-of-the-art specialist models.

Result: Performance dichotomy: Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality (hallucinating plausible high-frequency details) but lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics due to generative model stochasticity and pixel-level consistency issues.

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro is a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, but achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant challenge due to fundamental differences between generative and traditional vision approaches.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

*Yupeng Zhu,Xiongzhen Zhang,Ye Chen,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis using 2D-3D aligned proxy representation, enabling efficient animation with 3D control on low-power platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D animation pipelines are labor-intensive and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC approaches either inherit heavy 3D pipeline costs or sacrifice 3D controllability through video-synthesis methods. There's a fundamental trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control in single-image 3D animation generation.

Method: Proposes a lightweight framework using 2D-3D aligned proxy representation: coarse 3D estimate serves as structural carrier while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis.

Result: Achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms. Outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric/textural consistency, and precise interactive control. Enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines without accurate geometry or expensive optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the quality-control trade-off in 3D animation by separating geometric structure from appearance synthesis, offering practical, controllable animation generation with computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D animation is central to modern visual media, yet traditional production pipelines remain labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.
  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.

### [26] [Borrowing from anything: A generalizable framework for reference-guided instance editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15138)
*Shengxiao Zhou,Chenghua Li,Jianhao Huang,Qinghao Hu,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE is a framework for reference-guided instance editing that explicitly disentangles intrinsic appearance from extrinsic attributes in references to achieve better editing fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-guided instance editing methods suffer from semantic entanglement, where a reference's intrinsic appearance (what should be borrowed) is mixed with extrinsic attributes (context-specific features). This makes it difficult to determine what information to borrow from the reference and how to properly apply it to the target.

Method: GENIE uses three main components: 1) Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to correct spatial misalignments, 2) Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) that learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, and 3) Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism that learns how to render the appearance onto the target while preserving its structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset show that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

Conclusion: GENIE successfully addresses the semantic entanglement problem in reference-guided instance editing through explicit disentanglement, enabling more accurate borrowing of intrinsic appearance from references while preserving target structure.

Abstract: Reference-guided instance editing is fundamentally limited by semantic entanglement, where a reference's intrinsic appearance is intertwined with its extrinsic attributes. The key challenge lies in disentangling what information should be borrowed from the reference, and determining how to apply it appropriately to the target. To tackle this challenge, we propose GENIE, a Generalizable Instance Editing framework capable of achieving explicit disentanglement. GENIE first corrects spatial misalignments with a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM). Then, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, while a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism learns how to render this appearance onto the target, preserving its structure. Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset demonstrate that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFA task: assessing human action standardization with explainable feedback. CoT-AFA dataset with fitness/martial arts videos and chain-of-thought explanations. EFA framework fuses visual/semantic info for action assessment and feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods only identify what/where actions occur, lacking assessment of action standardization. Existing datasets lack labels for action standardization degree, and action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback.

Method: 1) Define Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task; 2) Create CoT-AFA dataset with fitness/martial arts videos and multi-level annotations; 3) Enrich with Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm; 4) Propose Explainable Fitness Assessor framework with parallel processing streams and dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual/semantic information.

Result: Achieved improvements: +16.0% in CIDEr for explanation generation, +2.7% in accuracy for action classification, +2.1% in accuracy for quality assessment. Demonstrates CoT-AFA's potential for future studies.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new AFA task and CoT-AFA dataset with chain-of-thought explanations. The proposed EFA framework effectively assesses actions while providing explainable feedback, showing significant improvements over baseline methods.

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

### [28] [EagleVision: A Dual-Stage Framework with BEV-grounding-based Chain-of-Thought for Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15160)
*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Hang Zhang,Mu Xu,Yang Han,Hong Zhang,Ding Yuan,Yifan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EagleVision: A dual-stage framework for spatial reasoning that combines macro perception (keyframe selection) with micro verification (BEV-grounded pose querying) to achieve strong spatial understanding in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial intelligence approaches have weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and untraceable evidence chains. Current "thinking with images" frameworks don't address key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought: global space perception under token budgets, explicit 3D hypothesis-frame association, and spatially grounded rewards for RL.

Method: Dual-stage framework: 1) Macro perception stage uses SPF-DPP (semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process) to select compact keyframes from long videos under fixed token budget. 2) Micro verification stage formalizes spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying - agent iteratively predicts poses on BEV plane, retrieves nearest real frames, trained purely by RL with spatial grounding reward scoring consistency between predicted poses and observed views.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models on VSI-Bench, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Conclusion: EagleVision successfully addresses key challenges in spatial reasoning through its dual-stage approach of macro perception and micro verification, enabling progressive spatial cognition with strong consistency and traceable evidence chains.

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

*Kaixing Long,Danyi Weng,Yun Mi,Zhentai Zhang,Yanmeng Lu,Jian Geng,Zhitao Zhou,Liming Zhong,Qianjin Feng,Wei Yang,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMUS-Net: A cross-modal ultra-scale learning network for multi-modal glomerular disease classification using TEM, OM, and IM images, addressing nanometer-to-micrometer scale differences with sparse multi-instance learning and cross-modal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal classification using renal biopsy images (TEM, OM, IM) can assist pathologists, but existing models struggle with feature fusion due to huge scale differences between nanoscale TEM and microscale OM/IM images.

Method: Proposes CMUS-Net with: 1) sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate TEM features, 2) cross-modal scale attention module for feature interaction, and 3) multiple loss functions to weigh modality importance.

Result: Achieves 95.37% ACC, 99.05% AUC, 95.32% F1-score on in-house dataset for classifying IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis. Outperforms other multi-modal/multi-scale methods and shows generalization in MN staging.

Conclusion: CMUS-Net effectively bridges nanometer-to-micrometer scale differences for multi-modal glomerular disease classification, following clinical pathology workflow and demonstrating superior performance and generalization capability.

Abstract: Constructing a multi-modal automatic classification model based on three types of renal biopsy images can assist pathologists in glomerular multi-disease identification. However, the substantial scale difference between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image features at the nanoscale and optical microscopy (OM) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) images at the microscale poses a challenge for existing multi-modal and multi-scale models in achieving effective feature fusion and improving classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales. On an in-house dataset, CMUS-Net achieves an ACC of 95.37+/-2.41%, an AUC of 99.05+/-0.53%, and an F1-score of 95.32+/-2.41%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMUS-Net outperforms other well-known multi-modal or multi-scale methods and show its generalization capability in staging MN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception evaluation metrics lack safety-specific measures. Safety evaluation requires distinguishing relevant from non-relevant objects, which criticality metrics address. There's a need for in-depth analysis of these metrics for reliable safety assessment of object detection systems.

Method: Comprehensive literature review to identify applicable criticality metrics, empirical validation using DeepAccident dataset with safety-critical scenarios, and proposal of two novel strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

Result: The approach demonstrates up to 100% improvement in criticality classification accuracy, significantly advancing safety evaluation capabilities for object detection systems in automated vehicles.

Conclusion: Criticality metrics are essential for safety evaluation of object detection in automated driving. The proposed bidirectional rating and multi-metric aggregation strategies substantially improve evaluation accuracy, offering a more reliable framework for assessing perception system safety.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

*Sarim Hashmi,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Samuele Poppi,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A resynthesis framework for deepfake detection that verifies authenticity with controllable false positive rates and achieves adversarial robustness against compute-restricted adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable due to: (i) inability to distinguish inauthentic content post-hoc (leading to unbounded false positive rates), and (ii) lack of robustness as adversaries can easily adapt to known detectors with minimal computational resources.

Method: Proposes a resynthesis framework that determines if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. Focuses on high-precision, low-recall setting against compute-restricted adversaries. Uses calibrated resynthesis method and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques across multiple modalities.

Result: The calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable low false positive rates. The method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed resynthesis framework addresses fundamental limitations of current deepfake detection by providing reliable authenticity verification with controlled false positive rates and robust defense against computationally efficient adversaries.

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

TL;DR: ERIENet: Efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network that parallelly processes multi-scale information and leverages green channel superiority for low-light enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time processing (146 FPS for 4K images).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAW-based low-light enhancement methods have two main limitations: 1) They sequentially process multi-scale information, making models heavy and slow, and 2) They ignore the green channel superiority in RAW images, missing opportunities for better reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes ERIENet with two key innovations: 1) Efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with channel-aware residual dense blocks for feature extraction, and 2) Green channel guidance branch that exploits rich information in green channels to guide image reconstruction with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on low-light image enhancement datasets, achieves real-time processing with over 146 FPS for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, and demonstrates higher efficiency than existing approaches.

Conclusion: ERIENet successfully addresses the limitations of existing RAW-based low-light enhancement methods by introducing parallel multi-scale processing and green channel guidance, achieving both superior reconstruction quality and real-time processing efficiency.

Abstract: RAW images have shown superior performance than sRGB images in many image processing tasks, especially for low-light image enhancement. However, most existing methods for RAW-based low-light enhancement usually sequentially process multi-scale information, which makes it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds. Besides, they usually ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, and fail to achieve better reconstruction performance with good use of green channel information. In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency. It also achieves an optimal speed of over 146 frame-per-second (FPS) for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 with 24G memory.

*Yufeng Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric for infrared and visible image fusion in UAV reconnaissance, addressing the "Noise Trap" problem where traditional metrics incorrectly reward noisy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional no-reference metrics like EN and AG fail in complex low-light UAV environments by misinterpreting sensor noise as valid detail, creating a "Noise Trap" that paradoxically assigns higher scores to noisy images and misguides fusion algorithms.

Method: Proposes the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric inspired by Weber's Law, focusing on relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility.

Result: Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude UAV scenarios compared to traditional metrics.

Conclusion: TBC metric effectively addresses the limitations of traditional no-reference metrics in low-light UAV reconnaissance by focusing on target-background contrast, providing a more reliable evaluation standard that aligns with human visual perception.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Plug: A plug-and-play module that transforms human meshes from camera to world coordinates by estimating camera rotation from human body cues rather than environmental features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human mesh reconstruction methods assume zero camera rotation, which works in camera coordinates but causes significant errors when transforming to world coordinates due to lack of camera rotation information.

Method: 1) Train a camera rotation prediction module using RGB images and depth maps rendered from initial mesh to estimate camera pitch angle based on human body spatial configuration. 2) Design a mesh adjustment module that integrates predicted camera parameters with initial mesh to simultaneously refine root joint orientation and body pose.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP, demonstrating accurate transformation from camera to world coordinates.

Conclusion: Mesh-Plug provides an effective human-centered solution for accurate 3D human mesh reconstruction in world coordinates by eliminating dependency on environmental cues and focusing on human body configuration for camera rotation estimation.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens flare removal methods fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares in complex real-world nighttime scenarios with diverse lighting conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes SLCFormer with two key modules: FFEM (Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module) for global contextual representations in frequency domain, and DESM (Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module) for local structural enhancement in spatial domain. Also introduces a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline for physically realistic training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flare7K++ dataset, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and demonstrates robust generalization to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

Conclusion: SLCFormer effectively addresses the challenge of nonuniform scattered flare removal in complex nighttime scenarios through its spectral-local context transformer framework, bridging optical physics with data-driven learning for superior performance.

Abstract: Lens flare is a common nighttime artifact caused by strong light sources scattering within camera lenses, leading to hazy streaks, halos, and glare that degrade visual quality. However, existing methods usually fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares, which severely reduces their applicability to complex real-world scenarios with diverse lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal. SLCFormer integrates two key modules: the Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM), which captures efficient global contextual representations in the frequency domain to model flare characteristics, and the Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement and directional features in the spatial domain for precise flare removal. Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training. Extensive experiments on the Flare7K++ dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and generalizing robustly to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space, but fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces that can be leveraged for more efficient adaptation.

Method: Null-LoRA performs low-rank adaptation within the null space of pre-trained models by freezing portions of low-rank matrices to reduce redundancy and enhance effective rank. It constrains the entire incremental update within the null space to maximize utilization of incremental updates for adapting to new tasks.

Result: Null-LoRA surpasses state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Null-space based adaptation provides a more parameter-efficient approach to fine-tuning large-scale models, achieving better performance with reduced parameter overhead by leveraging the inherent null spaces of pre-trained models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: CMAC-MMD framework reduces intersectional bias in medical AI by standardizing diagnostic certainty across patient subgroups without requiring demographic data during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalized patient subgroups, leading to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data.

Method: Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD) training framework that standardizes diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference.

Result: In dermatology: reduced intersectional missed diagnosis gap (ΔTPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving AUC from 0.94 to 0.97. In glaucoma screening: reduced ΔTPR from 0.41 to 0.31 with AUC improvement from 0.71 to 0.72.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable framework for developing accurate and equitable clinical decision support systems that perform reliably across diverse patient subgroups without increasing privacy risks.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs match or surpass specialized counting architectures for object enumeration, especially when prompted to generate intermediate object representations, but still struggle with complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counting methods use domain-specific architectures trained on predefined object categories, but large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) may offer more flexible open-set counting capabilities.

Method: Systematic comparison of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets and a novel benchmark with finer-grained visual property control.

Result: Most VLMs can approximately enumerate items in visual scenes, matching or surpassing specialized architectures. Accuracy significantly improves when VLMs generate intermediate representations (locations and verbal labels) of each object.

Conclusion: While VLMs show promise for open-set counting, none can reliably count objects in complex visual scenes, indicating need for further research to create AI systems that can deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

TL;DR: MMMamba: A cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening using Mamba architecture with multimodal interleaved scanning, achieving SOTA performance with linear computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based pan-sharpening methods with channel-wise concatenation lack adaptability to diverse spatial/spectral variations. Cross-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient and dilute fine-grained correspondences. Need for more efficient and effective cross-modal fusion for pan-sharpening.

Method: Proposes MMMamba framework built on Mamba architecture with linear computational complexity. Uses cross-modal in-context fusion (inspired by MMDiT) instead of cross-attention. Introduces novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism for effective PAN-MS information exchange. Supports zero-shot image super-resolution.

Result: Superior performance compared to existing SOTA techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks. Demonstrates effectiveness of in-context conditioning over cross-attention for pan-sharpening.

Conclusion: MMMamba provides an efficient and effective solution for pan-sharpening with linear complexity, overcoming limitations of traditional CNN and cross-attention approaches through in-context fusion and multimodal interleaved scanning.

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods still depend on real-world training samples, creating limitations in cost and scalability. The authors aim to eliminate this dependency entirely by generating synthetic training data from scratch.

Method: Two-agent framework: 1) Self-Refine Prompt Agent uses LLMs to iteratively craft diverse image prompts via refinement, memory, and exploration with CLIP-based filtering; 2) Image Generation Agent uses VLMs to synthesize images from prompts, with CLIP scoring for quality selection and ViT classifier for improved semantic relabeling.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 benchmarks without using any real training images, demonstrating the viability of LLM-driven synthetic data generation for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SynthSeg Agents enables cost-efficient and scalable semantic segmentation by generating high-quality training data entirely through LLM-driven agents, eliminating dependency on real images and opening new directions for zero-shot WSSS.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations. While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images.

TL;DR: Cross-modality distillation framework for single-panoramic-camera BEV segmentation using LiDAR-camera fusion teacher to train lightweight camera-only student.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce sensor complexity and deployment costs for BEV segmentation in autonomous driving while maintaining competitive performance, by enabling efficient single-camera systems through knowledge distillation from multi-modal teacher models.

Method: Uses novel LiDAR image representation (range, intensity, ambient channels) with voxel-aligned view transformer for spatial fidelity. A high-capacity LiDAR-camera fusion Teacher network extracts spatial/semantic features for cross-modality distillation to lightweight Student network using only single 360-degree panoramic camera.

Result: Teacher model achieves 25.6% IoU improvement over existing camera-based BEV methods on Dur360BEV. Distilled Student attains 8.5% IoU gain with state-of-the-art 31.2 FPS inference speed. Framework generalizes to diverse camera setups (validated on KITTI-360).

Conclusion: The approach provides practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in autonomous driving by reducing sensor complexity while maintaining competitive performance through cross-modality distillation.

Abstract: We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness. This approach reduces sensor complexity and deployment costs while providing a practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving.

*Antony Jerald,Dattesh Shanbhag,Sudhanya Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoMAC-MRI is an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts in MRI across different contrasts and orientations using supervised contrastive learning and affinity scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion artifacts degrade MRI quality and increase patient recalls, but existing automated quality assessment methods are limited to binary decisions with poor interpretability.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning to learn discriminative representations of motion severity, then computes grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade for transparent grade assignments.

Result: Evaluated on 5000+ expert-annotated brain MRI slices across multiple contrasts and views; affinity scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as interpretable measures of motion severity.

Conclusion: AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control with accurate grade detection and interpretable affinity scoring, potentially reducing unnecessary rescans and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSNet improves few-shot anomaly detection by addressing domain gaps between pre-trained features and target scenarios through prototypical feature adaptation and context-aware segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods rely on pre-trained features but overlook domain gaps between these representations and target scenarios, limiting performance.

Method: PCSNet uses two sub-networks: Prototypical Feature Adaptation (PFA) for better feature compactness and separation, and Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS) for pixel-level anomaly localization with pseudo anomalies for training.

Result: Achieves 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC on MVTec and MPDD in 8-shot scenarios, with promising results in real-world automotive plastic part inspection.

Conclusion: PCSNet effectively addresses domain gaps in FSAD, improving feature descriptiveness and achieving superior performance with limited training samples.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Can,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRKD introduces masked reverse knowledge distillation with image-level and feature-level masking to address overgeneralization in anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation for anomaly detection suffers from overgeneralization due to similarities between input and supervisory signals, limiting its effectiveness in distinguishing anomalies.

Method: Proposes Masked Reverse Knowledge Distillation (MRKD) with two key components: Image-Level Masking (ILM) to capture global information by differentiating input/supervisory signals, and Feature-Level Masking (FLM) that incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure sufficient local information representation.

Result: Achieves impressive performance on MVTec dataset: 98.9% image-level AU-ROC, 98.4% pixel-level AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. Extensive ablation experiments validate MRKD's superiority in mitigating overgeneralization.

Conclusion: MRKD effectively addresses the overgeneralization problem in knowledge distillation for anomaly detection through dual masking strategies, transforming reconstruction into restoration and achieving strong context capture capacity.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

*Parvesh Saini,Soumyadipta Maiti,Beena Rai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-based system that mimics human ability to read measurements from linear scales (syringe and measuring cylinder) using image processing and feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision models excel at tasks like object detection and classification, they lack the human-like ability to take accurate quantitative measurements from images. For laboratory robots to achieve full autonomy, they need to read measurements from instruments like humans do.

Method: 1) Correct orientation of randomly oriented syringes through transformations, 2) Reduce area of interest to just the linear scale portion, 3) Extract features: major markers, corresponding digits, and level indicator location, 4) Calculate final reading from extracted features.

Result: The system successfully reads measurements from syringes and measuring cylinders. When compared against human readings of the same instances, accurate correspondence was observed, demonstrating reliable performance.

Conclusion: The proposed human-inspired approach enables robots to read measurements from linear scales, advancing their capabilities for autonomous laboratory work. The method is efficient, robust, and shows promise for practical applications in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

*Junjie Chen,Fei Wang,Zhihao Huang,Qing Zhou,Kun Li,Dan Guo,Linfeng Zhang,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIMAR is a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts using turn-level masked autoregression and diffusion, achieving 15-30% improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human conversation involves continuous bidirectional exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues (head nods, gaze shifts, facial expressions) that convey attention and emotion. Existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, which hinders temporal coherence across conversational turns.

Method: TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression) is a causal framework that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history. A lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability.

Result: Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: TIMAR provides an effective causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models bidirectional dialogue dynamics while maintaining temporal coherence across turns, enabling more expressive avatars and interactive robots.

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots.

We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts.

*Shiran Ge,Chenyi Huang,Yuang Ai,Qihang Fan,Huaibo Huang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pro-GRPO is a dynamic framework that improves Group Relative Policy Optimization by proactively pruning low-variance trajectories during sampling, reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness through an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's effectiveness is limited by the conflict between needing large group sizes for optimization and prohibitive computational costs. The authors discovered that many trajectories cluster around the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value, creating computational inefficiency.

Method: Pro-GRPO integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. It uses an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy: first expands initial sampling group size to maximize trajectory diversity, then applies multi-step Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF) to latents to proactively terminate reward-clustered trajectories early, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate Pro-GRPO's generality and effectiveness. The high-variance subset selected by OVF outperforms larger unfiltered groups, and Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead while maintaining optimization quality.

Conclusion: Pro-GRPO successfully addresses the computational bottleneck in GRPO by dynamically pruning low-variance trajectories during sampling, enabling efficient use of larger initial groups for better trajectory diversity without prohibitive computational costs.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

TL;DR: A novel 3D semantic segmentation dataset for bridges with sensor-variation domain gap analysis shows existing models perform well but sensor differences can cause up to 11.4% mIoU performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses critical need for infrastructure inspection and maintenance by creating a specialized dataset for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges, enabling automated structural health monitoring.

Method: Created a novel dataset with high-resolution 3D scans of diverse bridge structures from various countries with detailed semantic labels. Evaluated three state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures and analyzed domain gaps caused by different sensors.

Result: All three architectures demonstrated robust performance on bridge segmentation. However, domain gaps from sensor variations can lead to performance degradation of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Conclusion: The dataset successfully enables accurate bridge component segmentation, but sensor-induced domain gaps pose significant challenges that need to be addressed for reliable infrastructure monitoring systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in sign language emotion recognition by introducing a new Japanese Sign Language dataset (eJSL) and using cross-lingual learning with British Sign Language data to overcome data scarcity and facial expression ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two main challenges in signer emotion recognition: 1) theoretical challenge of distinguishing between grammatical facial expressions (used in sign language grammar) and affective facial expressions (showing emotions), and 2) practical challenge of data scarcity for training models.

Method: 1) Created eJSL dataset with 1,092 video clips of 78 utterances expressed with 7 emotional states by two signers; 2) Used cross-lingual approach combining eJSL with BOBSL (British Sign Language dataset); 3) Applied temporal segment selection; 4) Incorporated hand motion features; 5) Compared with spoken language LLMs.

Result: Demonstrated that: 1) Textual emotion recognition from spoken language helps mitigate sign language data scarcity; 2) Temporal segment selection significantly impacts performance; 3) Hand motion features enhance emotion recognition accuracy; 4) Established stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

Conclusion: The cross-lingual approach effectively addresses sign language emotion recognition challenges, with temporal selection and hand motion being key factors for improved performance, surpassing spoken language models.

Abstract: Recognition of signers' emotions suffers from one theoretical challenge and one practical challenge, namely, the overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions and the scarcity of data for model training. This paper addresses these two challenges in a cross-lingual setting using our eJSL dataset, a new benchmark dataset for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language signers, and BOBSL, a large British Sign Language dataset with subtitles. In eJSL, two signers expressed 78 distinct utterances with each of seven different emotional states, resulting in 1,092 video clips. We empirically demonstrate that 1) textual emotion recognition in spoken language mitigates data scarcity in sign language, 2) temporal segment selection has a significant impact, and 3) incorporating hand motion enhances emotion recognition in signers. Finally we establish a stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task of action anticipation in basketball videos, specifically predicting which team will gain possession after a shot attempt (rebound prediction). It presents a large-scale dataset of 100,000 basketball clips with 2,000 annotated rebound events and benchmarks deep learning methods for this novel task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While computer vision has advanced sports analytics for tracking, pose estimation, and action recognition, action anticipation (predicting future events) in sports videos has received little attention. The authors aim to address this gap by focusing on rebound prediction in basketball, which has applications in real-time broadcasting and post-game analysis.

Method: The authors create a new self-curated dataset of 100,000 basketball video clips (300+ hours) with 2,000+ manually annotated rebound events. They benchmark state-of-the-art action anticipation methods on this dataset, representing the first application of deep learning to basketball rebound prediction. They also explore two complementary tasks: rebound classification and rebound spotting.

Result: The paper presents comprehensive baseline results showing both the feasibility and challenges of anticipating rebounds. The dataset supports multiple video understanding applications in basketball where no comparable datasets exist. Experimental results provide insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios.

Conclusion: This work establishes action anticipation in basketball as a valuable research direction, enabling applications in automated broadcasting and decision support tools. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, it advances predictive modeling for dynamic sports scenarios and provides a benchmark dataset for future research.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMART is a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model for Partially View-aligned Clustering that addresses distributional shifts across views to better exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often contains both aligned and unaligned views, making partially view-aligned clustering more practical than requiring strictly aligned views. Existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture shared semantics and suffer from distributional shifts across views that impair correspondence learning.

Method: Proposes SMART (Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model) that alleviates cross-view distributional shifts to facilitate semantic matching contrastive learning. The approach enables better exploitation of semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data by addressing representation heterogeneity.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that SMART consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem, showing improved learning effectiveness through better semantic matching.

Conclusion: SMART successfully addresses key challenges in partially view-aligned clustering by mitigating distributional shifts and enabling effective semantic matching contrastive learning, making it a superior solution for practical multi-view clustering scenarios with both aligned and unaligned data.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

*Simon Gutwein,Arthur Longuefosse,Jun Seita,Sabine Taschner-Mandl,Roxane Licandro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shallow channel-independent models outperform deep early-fusion CNNs for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex tissue imaging by better preserving marker-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning models for multiplex tissue imaging use early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across protein markers, but this may not be optimal for preserving marker-specific information needed for rare-cell discrimination.

Method: Proposed Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with only 5.5K parameters that preserves marker independence, compared against standard early-fusion CNNs and channel-separated architectures on Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers using contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation.

Result: Channel-independent architectures, especially CIM-S, achieve substantially stronger representations despite compact size, outperform early-fusion models in retaining marker-specific information and rare-cell discrimination, and remain stable across augmentation settings and marker subsets.

Conclusion: Lightweight channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning, demonstrating that preserving marker independence with deliberately shallow designs provides better inductive bias than increasing model scale.

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

TL;DR: Monocular depth foundation models hallucinate 3D structures from planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs (3D Mirage). The paper introduces a benchmark, evaluation metrics, and a parameter-efficient mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization through large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs (termed 3D Mirage). This represents an unquantified safety risk that needs to be addressed.

Method: 1) 3D-Mirage benchmark: first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. 2) Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. 3) Grounded Self-Distillation: parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The paper provides essential tools to diagnose and mitigate the 3D Mirage phenomenon, including a benchmark, evaluation metrics, and a mitigation method. The approach enables a shift in monocular depth estimation evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness.

Conclusion: The work introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame the 3D Mirage failure in monocular depth foundation models. It urges a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness, providing tools to foster research in this direction.

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of acquiring high-quality training data for GUI automation while maintaining annotation reliability and cost-effectiveness, and enabling practical deployment with standardized interfaces and privacy protection for real-world usage.

Method: 1) Self-evolving training pipeline with Calibrated Step Reward System that converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals; 2) Step-GUI family of models (4B/8B); 3) GUI-MCP (Model Context Protocol) with hierarchical architecture combining low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation; 4) AndroidDaily benchmark with real-world mobile usage patterns.

Conclusion: The work advances practical GUI agent development with efficient training, SOTA performance, standardized privacy-preserving interfaces, and real-world evaluation, demonstrating strong potential for deployment in everyday digital interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

### [56] [CLIP-FTI: Fine-Grained Face Template Inversion via CLIP-Driven Attribute Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15433)
*Longchen Dai,Zixuan Shen,Zhiheng Zhou,Peipeng Yu,Zhihua Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-FTI: A CLIP-driven framework for face template inversion that uses semantic embeddings of facial features to reconstruct photorealistic faces from leaked templates with fine-grained attribute details and improved transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face templates stored in recognition systems pose privacy risks when leaked. Existing inversion methods produce over-smoothed facial features with limited transferability, failing to reconstruct fine-grained facial attributes.

Method: Uses CLIP model to extract semantic embeddings of facial features, fuses them with leaked templates via cross-modal feature interaction network, projects into StyleGAN's latent space, and synthesizes face images with fine-grained attributes matching the template identity.

Result: Achieves higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, recovers sharper component-level attribute semantics, and improves cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets.

Conclusion: CLIP-FTI is the first method to use additional information beyond face templates for inversion, achieving state-of-the-art results in reconstructing photorealistic faces with fine-grained facial attributes from leaked templates.

Abstract: Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-DETrack: A spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network that preserves branch identity from budding to flowering by integrating spatial geometric priors with temporal motion consistency, achieving 93.6% BMA on Brassica napus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies, requiring solutions for stage-dependent tracking ambiguities.

Method: ST-DETrack integrates a spatial decoder (using geometric priors like position and angle for early-stage tracking) with a temporal decoder (exploiting motion consistency for late-stage occlusions). An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts between spatial and temporal cues, and a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities.

Result: Achieves 93.6% Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) on Brassica napus dataset, outperforming spatial baselines by 28.9 percentage points and temporal baselines by 3.3 percentage points.

Conclusion: ST-DETrack demonstrates robust long-term identity consistency in complex, dynamic plant architectures by effectively combining spatial and temporal information with biological constraints.

Abstract: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is essential for high-throughput phenotyping, yet it remains computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies. To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures.

*Malach Obisa Amonga,Benard Osero,Edna Too*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResNet-101 and Inception v3 models achieve 94-95% accuracy for wildlife detection, with Inception v3 slightly outperforming due to multi-scale feature extraction, though both struggle with visually similar species and challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife object detection is crucial for biodiversity conservation and ecological monitoring, but faces challenges from environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study aims to evaluate deep learning models' effectiveness under these complex conditions.

Method: Used ResNet-101 and Inception v3 architectures trained on wildlife image dataset with standardized preprocessing (resizing to max 800 pixels, RGB conversion, PyTorch tensor transformation). Employed 70:30 training-validation split for model development and evaluation.

Result: ResNet-101 achieved 94% classification accuracy and 0.91 mAP, while Inception v3 performed slightly better with 95% accuracy and 0.92 mAP. Both models showed strong feature extraction capabilities but struggled with visually similar species and challenging conditions like poor lighting and occlusion.

Conclusion: Both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective for wildlife object detection tasks, providing a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications, though challenges remain with species visual similarities and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

*Seyed Abolfazl Ghasemzadeh,Alexandre Alahi,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUMPL is a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that uses 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints, making it camera-calibration independent and deployable across arbitrary multi-view setups without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D pose estimation struggles with generalization to real-world scenarios due to scarce large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth captured under constrained conditions. Existing methods often rely on synthetic data for 2D-to-3D pose lifting.

Method: Builds on MPL framework with transformer-based architecture. Introduces 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints, making model independent of camera calibration and number of views. Uses View Fusion Transformer with learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays for multi-view consistency.

Result: Reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Shows robustness and scalability on in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets.

Conclusion: RUMPL provides a universal, camera-calibration independent solution for multi-view 3D pose estimation that generalizes well to real-world scenarios without requiring retraining or fine-tuning for different camera setups.

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

*Rohit Jena,Pratik Chaudhari,James C. Gee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning methods for MRI registration show competitive in-distribution performance but fail to generalize zero-shot to unseen contrasts/resolutions, contradicting claims of universal superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To independently re-evaluate claims from the LUMIR challenge that deep learning methods achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen MRI contrasts and resolutions, which contradicts established understanding of domain shift in deep learning.

Method: Rigorous evaluation protocols addressing potential instrumentation bias, testing on various MRI contrasts (T1w, T2, T2*, FLAIR), resolutions (including 0.6 mm isotropic), and species (human, macaque).

Result: (1) DL methods perform comparably to iterative methods on in-distribution T1w and macaque data; (2) Significant performance degradation on out-of-distribution contrasts (Cohen's d 0.7-1.5); (3) Scalability limitations on high-resolution data (0.6 mm); (4) High sensitivity to preprocessing choices.

Conclusion: Claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny; evaluation protocols should reflect practical clinical/research workflows rather than favoring specific method classes. Results align with established domain shift literature.

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

TL;DR: A new feed-forward 3DGS architecture that replaces rigid pixel grids with adaptive sub-pixel primitive detection, achieving SOTA novel view synthesis with fewer primitives and better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting models suffer from suboptimal primitive placement due to dense, rigid pixel grids, limiting both quality and efficiency in scene generation.

Method: Introduces an "Off The Grid" distribution using multi-resolution decoder inspired by keypoint detection to detect 3D Gaussian primitives at sub-pixel level across image patches. Trained end-to-end with 3D reconstruction backbone via self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models, generating photorealistic scenes in seconds with far fewer primitives. Also improves camera pose estimation through learned 3D Gaussian rendering.

Conclusion: The adaptive primitive placement approach enables more accurate and efficient scene generation while reducing artifacts. The method suggests opportunities for training foundational 3D models without labels through self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

TL;DR: VAAS is a dual-module framework combining Vision Transformers and SegFormer embeddings to detect and quantify image manipulations with interpretable anomaly scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated image forgeries are becoming more sophisticated, evading traditional forensic detectors. Existing methods lack explicit anomaly intensity measurement, limiting their ability to quantify manipulation severity.

Method: Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS) integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers with patch-level self-consistency scoring from SegFormer embeddings. This hybrid approach provides continuous, interpretable anomaly scores.

Result: VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance on DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps.

Conclusion: The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. Code is available open source.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

*Yuxiang Shi,Zhe Li,Yanwen Wang,Hao Zhu,Xun Cao,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeX-Portrait: A diffusion-based portrait animation method with disentangled control over head pose and facial expression using explicit pose transformation and implicit expression encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods lack high-fidelity disentangled control between head pose and facial expression, limiting applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation.

Method: 1) Design motion trainer to learn pose and expression encoders for decomposed driving signals; 2) Inject pose transformation via dual-branch conditioning and expression latent via cross attention in diffusion model; 3) Progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for identity consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

Conclusion: DeX-Portrait enables expressive portrait animation with precise disentangled control over pose and expression, addressing limitations of previous diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Can Ma. Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoCaliber is a confidence-aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Emotion Comprehension that verbalizes confidence in emotion predictions to address the subjectivity of emotion perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for VEC treat emotion prediction as deterministic, requiring a single definitive label, which fails to account for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception and overlooks alternative plausible interpretations.

Method: A three-stage training framework: 1) progressive structured reasoning, 2) teaching the model to verbalize confidence, and 3) calibrating confidence expression, resulting in EmoCaliber.

Result: EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods on VECBench benchmark in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses emotion perception subjectivity by providing confidence estimates, marking a step toward more reliable VEC systems.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

TL;DR: GeoMELT is a compact encoder-only transformer model for multi-task learning in remote sensing, addressing text generation from images and cross-modal retrieval efficiently with fewer parameters than large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) are expensive to train and use due to their massive parameter counts, making them inaccessible to most institutions. While parameter-efficient adaptation techniques exist, computational costs remain prohibitive for widespread adoption in remote sensing applications.

Method: Proposes GeoMELT (Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer), an encoder-only architecture that can handle multiple remote sensing tasks simultaneously. The model specifically addresses text generation from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval tasks in a unified framework while maintaining a compact parameter size.

Result: The GeoMELT model demonstrates efficacy and efficiency in established benchmarks, confirming that the proposed approach can effectively address multi-task learning in remote sensing while remaining computationally accessible.

Conclusion: Encoder-only architectures like GeoMELT offer a viable alternative to large vision-language models for remote sensing applications, providing effective multi-task learning capabilities with significantly reduced computational requirements and parameter counts.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical use of video data with human subjects, especially infants, requires robust anonymization methods that protect privacy while preserving essential facial attributes for research purposes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate compatible random face via diffusion model inpainting, 2) Seamlessly incorporate new identity into video frames through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer.

Result: BLANKET alters identity effectively and outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in de-identification level, facial attribute preservation, impact on human pose estimation (downstream task), and reduction of artifacts.

Conclusion: BLANKET provides an effective solution for infant face anonymization in videos, balancing privacy protection with preservation of essential facial attributes, with code available as an easy-to-use demo.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects.

Result: GRAN-TED encoder achieves SOTA on TED-6K benchmark and demonstrates performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks.

Conclusion: GRAN-TED provides both an efficient evaluation framework (TED-6K) and a superior text encoder training method, addressing key challenges in text encoder development for diffusion models.

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

### [68] [On the Effectiveness of Textual Prompting with Lightweight Fine-Tuning for SAM3 Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15564)
*Roni Blushtein-Livnon,Osher Rafaeli,David Ioffe,Amir Boger,Karen Sandberg Esquenazi,Tal Svoray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3 framework evaluated for remote sensing image segmentation using textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies under limited supervision, showing hybrid approaches work best while text-only performs poorly for irregular targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image segmentation faces challenges due to limited annotated data and domain gap between overhead imagery and natural images used in foundational models, requiring effective adaptation under limited supervision.

Method: Evaluated SAM3 concept-driven framework for RS imagery across four target types using textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies. Conducted lightweight fine-tuning with increasing supervision levels alongside zero-shot inference.

Result: Combining semantic and geometric cues yields highest performance. Text-only prompting performs worst, especially for irregular targets. Light fine-tuning with text prompts offers practical trade-off for regular targets. Performance improves from zero-shot to fine-tuning but shows diminishing returns with more supervision.

Conclusion: Hybrid prompting works best for RS segmentation. Text-only prompts have limited semantic alignment with overhead imagery. Modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. Under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain persistent challenges, especially for irregular targets.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoonSeg3R enables online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation using CUT3R geometric priors, achieving competitive performance with RGB-D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods rely on posed RGB-D sequences, failing in monocular settings. The paper addresses the need for online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation without depth sensors.

Method: Proposes MoonSeg3R with three key components: (1) self-supervised query refinement with spatial-semantic distillation to transform 2D VFM masks into 3D queries, (2) 3D query index memory for temporal consistency via contextual query retrieval, and (3) state-distribution token from CUT3R as mask identity descriptor for cross-frame fusion.

Result: First method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems on ScanNet200 and SceneNN datasets.

Conclusion: MoonSeg3R successfully addresses the limitation of existing RGB-D-dependent methods by leveraging CUT3R geometric priors, enabling practical online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation with competitive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems. Code and models will be released.

### [70] [IMKD: Intensity-Aware Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation for Camera-Radar Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15581)
*Shashank Mishra,Karan Patil,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMKD is a radar-camera 3D object detection framework using multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves sensor characteristics while enhancing complementary strengths, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods for radar-camera fusion often transfer modality-specific features directly, which distorts each sensor's unique characteristics and degrades their individual strengths. There's a need for a distillation approach that preserves sensor intrinsic properties while amplifying their complementary benefits.

Method: IMKD uses a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar with structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused intensity-guided distillation to highlight useful geometry/depth information at fusion level, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism for effective feature alignment and calibration.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes benchmark show IMKD achieves 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

Conclusion: IMKD successfully preserves sensor characteristics while enhancing complementary strengths through multi-level knowledge distillation, establishing a new state-of-the-art for radar-camera 3D object detection without LiDAR at inference time.

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

TL;DR: FlexAvatar creates complete 3D head avatars from single images by combining monocular and multi-view training via transformer with bias sinks, achieving better 3D completeness than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete 3D head reconstructions from single images due to limited multi-view data and entanglement issues in monocular training.

Method: Transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens (bias sinks) that enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets.

Result: Generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations, outperforming existing methods in view extrapolation and achieving smooth latent avatar space for identity interpolation.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar effectively addresses 3D completeness challenges by leveraging both monocular and multi-view data, creating high-quality avatars from minimal input.

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

*Shengming Yin,Zekai Zhang,Zecheng Tang,Kaiyuan Gao,Xiao Xu,Kun Yan,Jiahao Li,Yilei Chen,Yuxiang Chen,Heung-Yeung Shum,Lionel M. Ni,Jingren Zhou,Junyang Lin,Chenfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Qwen-Image-Layered is a diffusion model that decomposes RGB images into multiple RGBA layers for isolated editing, using RGBA-VAE, VLD-MMDiT architecture, and multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual generative models struggle with consistency in image editing due to raster images' entangled nature, unlike professional design tools that use layered representations for isolated edits.

Method: Three key components: (1) RGBA-VAE to unify RGB and RGBA latent representations, (2) VLD-MMDiT architecture for variable-layer decomposition, (3) Multi-stage training to adapt pretrained models. Plus a pipeline to extract multilayer images from PSD files for training data.

Result: Significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image-Layered enables inherent editability through semantic layer decomposition, addressing consistency issues in image editing by adopting professional design principles.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

*Johannes Hägerlind,Bao-Long Tran,Urs Waldmann,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust method for camera pose estimation and calibration that improves SfM pipelines through better correspondence subsampling and incremental view selection, particularly effective for cameras with strong radial distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SfM has improved camera calibration accuracy, challenges remain, especially for multi-camera setups used in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. The paper aims to address these limitations by improving SfM pipeline components.

Method: Analyzes individual components in SfM pipeline and identifies design choices that improve accuracy. Main contributions: (1) investigates optimal subsampling of predicted correspondences from dense matchers for estimation, (2) develops selection criteria for incremental view addition. Also demonstrates correspondence subsampling in global SfM setting initialized with VGGT.

Result: Significant improvement in accuracy, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% vs 40.4% vanilla VGGT). The proposed pipeline generalizes across wide range of camera setups and could become useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust method that improves SfM pipelines through better correspondence handling and view selection, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains particularly for challenging camera setups with strong distortion.

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

*Morgan Coe,Gruffudd Jones,Leah-Nani Alconcel,Marina Gashinova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using sub-THz ISAR imaging with sequential feature detection and tracking for Space Domain Awareness, enabling robust recognition of satellite external structures through Hough transform-based feature tracking across aligned image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing population of resident space objects (RSOs), detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed for Space Domain Awareness. Space-based sensing can inspect RSOs at shorter ranges without atmospheric interference, but requires robust feature recognition methods.

Method: The approach uses sub-THz ISAR imaging with sequential feature detection and tracking. Features are detected using a gradient-by-ratio edge detection method followed by a double-weighted Hough transform. Images are aligned via affine transformations, and linear features are tracked throughout sequences to increase detection confidence.

Result: The method demonstrates increased confidence in feature detection and classification through sequential tracking. It successfully detects and tracks linear features in ISAR imagery, with an example use-case showing robust detection of shadowing as a feature.

Conclusion: Sequential feature tracking in ISAR imagery enhances Space Domain Awareness capabilities by providing more reliable detection and classification of satellite external structures, with potential applications in satellite inspection and monitoring.

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

*Yu Zheng,Jie Hu,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new 4D occupancy spatio-temporal persistence (OccSTeP) framework for autonomous driving that handles reactive forecasting (what will happen) and proactive forecasting (what would happen given specific actions), with a novel benchmark and world model achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires persistent 3D scene understanding that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. Current approaches lack comprehensive handling of both reactive and proactive forecasting in challenging scenarios with noisy inputs.

Method: Proposes OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model with dense voxel-based scene state that incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context using linear-complexity attention and recurrent state-space modules. Features ego-motion compensation for online inference and robustness to missing/noisy historical sensor data.

Result: Achieves average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain) on the new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios including erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames.

Conclusion: The OccSTeP concept and OccSTeP-WM model effectively address both reactive and proactive forecasting for autonomous driving, demonstrating robust performance in challenging temporal scenarios and enabling open-source availability for community advancement.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

*Ian J. Maquignaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AllSky is a new sky-model that learns from physically captured HDR imagery to generate more realistic environment maps for outdoor scene rendering, addressing limitations of existing DNN sky-models that fail to achieve photorealism and full dynamic range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sky-models and DNN-generated HDR imagery fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies and cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for full dynamic range of outdoor illumination, limiting their usefulness for accurate scene relighting.

Method: AllSky is a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI. The authors study input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation methods for sky-models, and provide intuitive user control over sun positioning and cloud formations.

Result: AllSky achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance, expands current functionality with intuitive user control over environment maps, and demonstrates that existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models.

Conclusion: The work shows progress in HDR literature has been tangential to sky-modelling, with current limitations being prohibitive for scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications. AllSky represents a step forward in achieving more realistic sky rendering for outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications

TL;DR: IC-Effect is a DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that preserves spatial/temporal consistency while synthesizing complex effects like flames and particles using instruction guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video VFX editing is challenging because effects must blend seamlessly with unchanged backgrounds, and existing models fail to meet requirements for background preservation and efficient learning from limited paired data.

Method: Uses instruction-guided DiT framework with source video as contextual conditions, two-stage training (general editing adaptation + Effect-LoRA), and spatiotemporal sparse tokenization for computational efficiency.

Result: Delivers high-quality, controllable, temporally consistent VFX editing across 15 visual styles, with new dataset released for VFX editing.

Conclusion: IC-Effect opens new possibilities for video creation by enabling precise background preservation and natural effect injection with strong instruction following and efficient effect modeling.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InpaintDPO: A DPO-based framework for foreground-conditioned inpainting that addresses spatial relationship hallucinations between foreground subjects and generated backgrounds through specialized preference optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foreground-conditioned inpainting methods suffer from Spatial Relationship Hallucinations (inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints) between foreground subjects and generated backgrounds. The subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it difficult to quantify and apply traditional RLHF methods.

Method: Proposes InpaintDPO framework with three key innovations: 1) MaskDPO confines preference optimization to background regions while retaining inpainting loss in foreground; 2) Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations for boundary coherence; 3) Shared Commonality Preference Optimization enhances understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples.

Result: The framework ensures plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements, addresses gradient conflicts in standard DPO, enhances foreground-background boundary coherence, and promotes shared spatial rationality across high-quality samples.

Conclusion: InpaintDPO successfully addresses spatial relationship hallucinations in foreground-conditioned inpainting through specialized DPO-based techniques, providing a robust solution for generating harmonious backgrounds with appropriate spatial relationships to given foreground subjects.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

*Jiacheng Cui,Bingkui Tong,Xinyue Bi,Xiaohan Zhao,Jiacheng Liu,Zhiqiang shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft labels can cause semantic drift when using few crops per image, but combining them with hard labels as corrective anchors improves generalization in dataset distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft labels from teacher models are widely used for knowledge transfer but suffer from local semantic drift when only limited crops per image are used - crops may visually resemble wrong classes, causing soft embeddings to deviate from ground-truth semantics and creating training-testing distribution misalignment.

Method: Proposes HALD (Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift), a training paradigm that uses hard labels as intermediate corrective signals to calibrate semantic drift while retaining soft labels' fine-grained advantages. Theoretically analyzes drift emergence under few soft-label supervision and shows hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment.

Result: Achieves 42.7% accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Shows consistent improvements in generalization across dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hard labels provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift in soft-label-dominated training. The findings re-establish hard labels' importance as complementary tools and call for rethinking their role in modern training paradigms.

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

Motivation: While vision-text compression (VTC) achieves 3x-20x token compression for LLMs, its impact on vision-language models' long-context capabilities remains under-investigated. The authors aim to systematically assess how VTC affects VLMs' ability to understand and reason with compressed long texts.

Method: Introduces the first VTC benchmark with three evaluation settings: VTC-Retrieval (information retrieval/aggregation), VTC-Reasoning (inferring latent associations with minimal lexical overlap), and VTC-Memory (comprehensive QA within long-term dialogue memory). Also establishes VTCBench-Wild for diverse input scenarios. Evaluates leading open-source and proprietary models.

Result: Most VLMs exhibit surprisingly poor long-context understanding with VTC-compressed information, despite good OCR decoding capabilities. They fail to capture long associations or dependencies in the context, revealing a significant gap in VTC performance.

Conclusion: This study provides foundational understanding of VTC limitations and serves as a basis for designing more efficient and scalable vision-language models that can better handle compressed long-context information.

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

TL;DR: Training pipeline combining synthetic images with neural style transfer improves deep vision models' robustness to common corruptions, achieving SOTA results on corruption benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep vision models are vulnerable to common corruptions, and existing data augmentation techniques need improvement for better corruption robustness.

Method: Proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer, systematically analyzing effects of both augmentations and their hyperparameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness: 93.54% on CIFAR-10-C, 74.9% on CIFAR-100-C, and 50.86% on TinyImageNet-C. Stylization and synthetic data complement each other and work with some rule-based augmentations like TrivialAugment.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data with neural style transfer creates an effective training augmentation pipeline that significantly improves model robustness to common corruptions, despite style transfer degrading image quality metrics like FID.

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Conclusion: Skyra provides both detection and explanation capabilities for AI-generated videos, addressing limitations of existing binary classification methods and advancing explainable AI video detection.

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can replicate human visual judgments zero-shot, enabling VLIC - a diffusion-based image compression system post-trained with VLM preferences instead of traditional perceptual losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion metrics like MSE don't align well with human perception. While prior work uses perceptual losses trained on human judgments, this paper explores whether VLMs can provide zero-shot human-like judgments for compression optimization.

Method: VLIC (Vision-Language Models for Image Compression) uses diffusion-based compression post-trained with VLM binary judgments via preference optimization, rather than distilling VLM judgments into separate perceptual loss networks.

Result: VLIC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned compression across datasets, validated by perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. VLMs can effectively replicate human 2AFC judgments zero-shot.

Conclusion: VLMs provide powerful zero-shot visual reasoning for compression alignment, enabling effective preference-based training without separate perceptual loss networks, with extensive analysis of VLM reward design and training procedures.

Abstract: Evaluations of image compression performance which include human preferences have generally found that naive distortion functions such as MSE are insufficiently aligned to human perception. In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. We additionally conduct an extensive analysis of the VLM-based reward design and training procedure and share important insights. More visuals are available at https://kylesargent.github.io/vlic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Resampling Forcing: A teacher-free framework for training autoregressive video diffusion models from scratch that addresses exposure bias through self-resampling and enables efficient long-horizon generation via history routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models suffer from exposure bias (train-test mismatch), and existing solutions rely on bidirectional teacher models or online discriminators rather than end-to-end training from scratch.

Method: 1) Self-resampling scheme simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training; 2) Sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss; 3) History routing dynamically retrieves top-k most relevant history frames for each query to enable efficient long-horizon generation.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos due to native-length training.

Conclusion: Resampling Forcing provides an effective teacher-free framework for training autoregressive video diffusion models from scratch that addresses exposure bias and enables efficient long-horizon generation with better temporal consistency.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

*Yu Wang,Juhyung Ha,Frangil M. Ramirez,Yuchen Wang,David J. Crandall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GateFusion introduces a hierarchical gated fusion decoder with auxiliary losses for active speaker detection, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Late fusion approaches in active speaker detection fail to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions needed for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios.

Method: Combines pretrained unimodal encoders with Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate) for progressive multi-depth fusion using bimodally-conditioned gates, plus Masked Alignment Loss and Over-Positive Penalty auxiliary objectives.

Result: Achieves 77.8% mAP (+9.4%) on Ego4D-ASD, 86.1% mAP (+2.9%) on UniTalk, 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on WASD, and competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker with strong generalization in out-of-domain tests.

Conclusion: GateFusion's hierarchical fusion approach with auxiliary losses significantly improves active speaker detection performance and generalization across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

*Leo Segre,Or Hirschorn,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes converting single-view foundation models into multi-view foundation models by adding 3D-aware attention layers to improve feature consistency across different views of the same 3D scene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models process each image independently, leading to inconsistent features for the same 3D point across different views. This inconsistency limits their effectiveness in multi-view scenarios where consistent feature representation is crucial for 3D understanding tasks.

Method: Augments Transformers-based foundation models (DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. This approach operates directly in image space without needing to build a consistent 3D model of features.

Result: Quantitative experiments show the method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models. Demonstrated effectiveness in surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully converts single-view foundation models into multi-view foundation models, enabling consistent feature representation across different views while maintaining the benefits of working directly in image space.

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

TL;DR: GPiCA is a photorealistic head avatar system combining triangle mesh and 3D Gaussians for efficient mobile rendering, achieving Gaussian-based realism with mesh-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create photorealistic head avatars that can be efficiently rendered on mobile devices while maintaining high visual quality, addressing the limitations of purely mesh-based or purely Gaussian-based approaches.

Method: Hybrid representation combining triangle mesh for facial skin (surface areas) and anisotropic 3D Gaussians for hair/beard (non-surface areas). Uses unified differentiable rendering pipeline treating mesh as semi-transparent layer within 3D Gaussian Splatting framework. Neural networks decode facial expression codes into 3D mesh, RGBA texture, and 3D Gaussians.

Result: Achieves the realism of purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars, enabling efficient mobile rendering of photorealistic head avatars.

Conclusion: GPiCA successfully combines the strengths of both mesh and Gaussian representations to create efficient, photorealistic avatars suitable for mobile devices, demonstrating a promising hybrid approach for real-time avatar rendering.

Abstract: We present Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA), photorealistic head avatars that can be generated from multi-view images and efficiently rendered on mobile devices. GPiCA utilizes a unique hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians. This combination maximizes memory and rendering efficiency while maintaining a photorealistic appearance. The triangle mesh is highly efficient in representing surface areas like facial skin, while the 3D Gaussians effectively handle non-surface areas such as hair and beard. To this end, we develop a unified differentiable rendering pipeline that treats the mesh as a semi-transparent layer within the volumetric rendering paradigm of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We train neural networks to decode a facial expression code into three components: a 3D face mesh, an RGBA texture, and a set of 3D Gaussians. These components are rendered simultaneously in a unified rendering engine. The networks are trained using multi-view image supervision. Our results demonstrate that GPiCA achieves the realism of purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars.

TL;DR: DiffusionVL enables converting powerful autoregressive vision-language models to diffusion-based models through simple fine-tuning, achieving competitive performance with less data and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for multimodal tasks but current diffusion VLMs lag behind autoregressive models. The paper explores whether existing powerful AR models can be converted to diffusion VLMs.

Method: Proposes DiffusionVL, a method to translate any powerful AR model into diffusion paradigm through simple fine-tuning. Introduces block-decoding design for arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse.

Result: Achieves 34.4% gain on MMMU-Pro (vision) and 37.5% gain on MME (Cog.) benchmarks with less than 5% of training data compared to prior methods, plus 2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: Paradigm shift from AR to diffusion is effective, enabling competitive performance with existing models while offering faster inference and reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning (a classical paradigm) remains competitive with modern approaches, offering a simple, stable, and efficient alternative to latent-space methods for learning representations from pixels.

Method: Enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and capable architectures, trained on 2B web-crawled images using self-curation strategy with minimal human intervention.

Result: Pixio performs competitively across diverse downstream tasks including monocular depth estimation (Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales.

Conclusion: Pixel-space self-supervised learning via autoencoders serves as a promising alternative and complement to latent-space approaches, demonstrating that classical paradigms remain relevant and effective in modern computer vision.

Abstract: At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.
