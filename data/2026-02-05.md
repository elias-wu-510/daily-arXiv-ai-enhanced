Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.

*Ali Bayeh,Samira Sadaoui,Malek Mouhoub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TruKAN is a new neural architecture that improves KAN by replacing B-spline basis with truncated power functions, achieving better accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, creating a more interpretable and efficient KAN variant for complex vision tasks.

Method: Proposes TruKAN architecture that replaces KAN's B-spline basis with truncated power functions from k-order spline theory. Each layer combines truncated power term with polynomial term, using shared or individual knots. Integrated into EfficientNet-V2 framework and evaluated against MLP-, KAN-, and SineKAN-based models with hybrid optimization and layer normalization techniques.

Result: TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage on complex vision tasks, demonstrating advantages beyond prior KAN studies. Shows improved training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures.

Conclusion: TruKAN successfully balances approximation efficacy with transparency, offering greater interpretability through simplified basis functions and knot configurations while maintaining KAN's expressiveness and enhancing performance in computer vision applications.

Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.

*Maxx Richard Rahman,Mostafa Hammouda,Wolfgang Maass*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGAN uses diffusion modeling to generate synthetic longitudinal brain scans and attention-guided CNN to detect early Alzheimer's disease from limited clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early Alzheimer's diagnosis is challenging due to subtle, irregular brain changes in prodromal stages. Existing deep learning methods need large longitudinal datasets and struggle with temporal continuity and modality irregularities in real clinical data.

Method: DiGAN integrates latent diffusion modeling to synthesize realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, and an attention-guided convolutional network to capture discriminative structural-temporal patterns for classification.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets show DiGAN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its potential for early-stage Alzheimer's detection.

Conclusion: DiGAN effectively addresses data limitations and temporal irregularities in clinical neuroimaging, showing promise for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.

TL;DR: PriorProbe is a novel method that uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People to recover individual cognitive priors, enabling personalization of neural networks for facial expression recognition with improved performance on ambiguous stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for eliciting individual-level cognitive priors either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases, limiting effective personalization of neural networks.

Method: PriorProbe uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People to recover fine-grained, individual-specific priors, applied to facial expression recognition tasks to personalize a state-of-the-art neural network.

Result: PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks by accurately recovering individual cognitive priors.

Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.

### [5] [Explainable Computer Vision Framework for Automated Pore Detection and Criticality Assessment in Additive Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03883)
*Akshansh Mishra,Rakesh Morisetty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Explainable AI framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in 3D printed parts using tomography data, revealing surface proximity as the dominant factor in defect criticality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internal porosity in additive manufacturing compromises structural performance, and existing automated defect detection methods lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions.

Method: Reconstructed 3D tomographic volumes, used intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis to identify 500 pores, characterized each pore with geometric descriptors (size, aspect ratio, extent, spatial position), built pore interaction network with 24,950 connections, used machine learning to predict criticality scores, and applied SHAP analysis for feature importance quantification.

Result: Normalized surface distance dominates model predictions with more than 10x greater importance than all other descriptors; pore size provides minimal influence; geometric parameters show negligible impact; strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: The interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing, addressing the interpretability gap in existing defect detection methods.

Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.

### [6] [4DPC$^2$hat: Towards Dynamic Point Cloud Understanding with Failure-Aware Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03890)
*Xindan Zhang,Weilong Yan,Yufei Shi,Xuerui Qiu,Tao He,Ying Li,Ming Li,Hehe Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DPC²hat is the first multimodal large language model for dynamic point cloud understanding, featuring a large-scale dataset and Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs focus on static 3D objects, leaving dynamic point cloud sequences unexplored due to lack of large-scale datasets and difficulties in modeling spatio-temporal motions.

Method: 1) Construct 4DPC²hat-200K dataset via topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning; 2) Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM for long-range dependencies; 3) Failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy for iterative improvement.

Result: Significant improvements in action understanding and temporal reasoning compared to existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

Conclusion: 4DPC²hat successfully bridges the gap in dynamic point cloud understanding, providing both dataset and model advancements for 4D point cloud analysis with superior performance.

Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.

### [7] [Audit After Segmentation: Reference-Free Mask Quality Assessment for Language-Referred Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03892)
*Jinxing Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Yaoting Wang,Zongyan Han,Jiaqi Ma,Henghui Ding,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Hisham Cholakkal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MQA-RefAVS, a new task for assessing segmentation mask quality in audio-visual-language segmentation without ground truth, with benchmark MQ-RAVSBench and MLLM-based auditor MQ-Auditor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-AVS systems generate segmentation masks but lack interpretable quality assessment. There's a need to evaluate mask quality without ground truth references and provide actionable diagnoses.

Method: Proposes MQA-RefAVS task requiring IoU estimation, error type identification, and quality-control decisions. Creates MQ-RAVSBench benchmark with diverse error modes. Develops MQ-Auditor, a multimodal LLM that explicitly reasons over audio, visual, language, and mask information.

Result: MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs. It can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

Conclusion: MQA-RefAVS addresses the underexplored area of mask quality assessment in multimodal segmentation, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations without ground truth, enabling better diagnosis and improvement of segmentation systems.

Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.

*Yibing Wang,Shuang Li,Tingting Huang,Yu Zhang,Chulhong Kim,Seongwook Choi,Changhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPAIR enables ultrafast sub-second 3D photoacoustic iterative reconstruction using Gaussian kernels and GPU acceleration, achieving orders-of-magnitude speedup over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms for 3D photoacoustic computed tomography suffer from extremely long reconstruction times (hundreds of seconds to hours), which severely limits their practical clinical applicability for large-scale imaging.

Method: GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels, derives analytical closed-form expressions for pressure waves, and implements GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators for computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments, representing orders-of-magnitude acceleration compared to traditional iterative reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D photoacoustic reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications by overcoming the computational bottleneck of traditional iterative methods.

Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.

*Hugo Markoff,Stefan Hein Bengtson,Michael Ørsted*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT foundation models with dimensionality reduction and clustering can achieve near-perfect species-level clustering of animal images without manual labeling, enabling efficient biodiversity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of animal images is a bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring. The study aims to determine if Vision Transformer models can automate species-level clustering from unlabeled images.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating 5 ViT models combined with 5 dimensionality reduction techniques and 4 clustering algorithms (2 supervised, 2 unsupervised) across 60 species (30 mammals, 30 birds), using 200 validated images per species.

Result: Near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering. Unsupervised approaches achieved competitive performance (0.943) with only 1.14% images rejected as outliers. Robust to long-tailed species distributions, and over-clustering revealed intra-specific variation (age, sex, pelage differences).

Conclusion: ViT foundation models can effectively reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images to species-level clusters, significantly reducing manual labeling burden. The approach works well for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios, and can reveal ecologically meaningful intra-specific patterns. An open-source toolkit is provided with recommendations for ecologists.

Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.

### [10] [Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Toward Fairness Without Harm from Vision to LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03895)
*Xuwei Tan,Ziyu Hu,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NH-Fair is a unified benchmark for fairness evaluation across vision and vision-language models that shows many debiasing methods don't outperform well-tuned ERM baselines, identifies key training choices affecting fairness, and reveals that data augmentation consistently improves fairness without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often amplify social biases, but comparing bias mitigation methods is difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of different model types, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that prevents fair comparisons.

Method: NH-Fair introduces a unified benchmark spanning both vision models and large vision-language models with standardized data, metrics, and training protocols. It includes systematic ERM tuning studies to identify influential training choices, evaluates various debiasing methods against well-tuned baselines, and analyzes fairness across supervised and zero-shot regimes.

Result: Key findings: (1) Many debiasing methods don't reliably outperform well-tuned ERM baselines; (2) Composite data-augmentation consistently delivers fairness gains without sacrificing utility; (3) LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy but still exhibit subgroup disparities; (4) Scaling gains are smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices; (5) Systematic tuning identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities.

Conclusion: NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous fairness evaluation. It shows that careful hyperparameter tuning is crucial for fair comparisons, data augmentation emerges as a practical fairness strategy, and while LVLMs improve accuracy, they don't eliminate fairness concerns, suggesting architectural and training choices matter more than scaling alone.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.

*Qiuming Luo,Tao Zeng,Feng Li,Heming Liu,Rui Mao,Chang Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASA-Net: An entropy-aware structural alignment network for zero-shot handwritten Chinese character recognition that addresses hierarchical topology and uneven information density through information-theoretic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot HCCR approaches treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting hierarchical topology and uneven information density of different components, leading to suboptimal visual-semantic alignment.

Method: Proposes EASA-Net with three key components: 1) Information Entropy Prior for dynamic positional embedding modulation, 2) Dual-View Radical Tree for multi-granularity structural features, and 3) Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion for decoding augmentation using semantic neighbor centroids.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in zero-shot setting, and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with rapid adaptability using minimal support samples.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-aware structural alignment effectively bridges the visual-semantic gap in zero-shot HCCR by modeling hierarchical topology and information density, offering superior recognition performance and data efficiency.

Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.

### [13] [Phaedra: Learning High-Fidelity Discrete Tokenization for the Physical Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03915)
*Levi Lingsch,Georgios Kissas,Johannes Jakubik,Siddhartha Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phaedra is a new tokenizer designed for scientific images that improves reconstruction accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization for PDE datasets compared to existing image tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers are optimized for realistic visual perception but struggle with scientific images that have large dynamic ranges and require preservation of physical/spectral properties. There's a need for tokenizers specifically designed for scientific data.

Method: Proposed Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition, to better capture both fine details and precise magnitudes in scientific images.

Result: Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across PDE datasets and shows strong out-of-distribution generalization to three complex tasks: known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation/weather data.

Conclusion: Phaedra addresses the limitations of existing tokenizers for scientific images, providing better preservation of physical properties and enabling more accurate modeling of PDE systems and real-world scientific data.

Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatiaLab is a new benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision-language models using 1,400 real-world visual question-answer pairs across 30 task types, revealing significant performance gaps between VLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial reasoning benchmarks rely on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs actually encounter.

Method: Created SpatiaLab benchmark with 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories (Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, 3D Geometry) with five subcategories each, totaling 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation.

Result: Experiments show substantial performance gaps: In multiple-choice setup, best model (InternVL3.5-72B) achieves 54.93% accuracy vs 87.57% for humans. In open-ended setting, best model (GPT-5-mini) scores 40.93% vs 64.93% for humans, with all models showing 10-25% performance drop compared to multiple-choice.

Conclusion: SpatiaLab exposes critical limitations in VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities, particularly in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. The benchmark provides a diverse, real-world evaluation framework to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

### [15] [Entropy Reveals Block Importance in Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03918)
*Peihao Xiang,Kaida Wu,Ou Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Data-free block pruning for masked self-supervised vision transformers using information entropy of pretrained weights to identify redundant blocks without needing any data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have large model sizes that create deployment challenges, and there's a need to understand if all transformer blocks are equally important for downstream performance without requiring data access for pruning.

Method: Gardener - a data-free, one-shot block-level pruning principle that uses information entropy of pretrained block weights to estimate importance. The key insight is that weight entropy strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity from iterative block removal and finetuning.

Result: Gardener matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Even after pruning up to 91.7% of blocks, models retain competitive transfer performance on video recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have substantial block-level redundancy, and information-theoretic analysis provides a principled, efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning without data access.

Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.

### [16] [TiCLS : Tightly Coupled Language Text Spotter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04030)
*Leeje Jang,Yijun Lin,Yao-Yi Chiang,Jerod Weinman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiCLS is an end-to-end text spotter that incorporates external linguistic knowledge from character-level pretrained language models to improve recognition of ambiguous or fragmented scene text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text spotting methods rely mainly on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or use pretrained models misaligned with word-level granularity of scene text.

Method: TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, which can be initialized by a pretrained character-level language model. This enables robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text by explicitly incorporating external linguistic knowledge.

Result: Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text datasets demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of pretrained language model-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

Conclusion: The paper shows that explicitly incorporating external linguistic knowledge from character-level pretrained language models significantly improves scene text spotting performance, especially for ambiguous or fragmented text instances.

Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.

TL;DR: AnyStyle is a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot 3D scene stylization using both textual and visual style inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing demand for rapid 3D asset creation, but existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods lack effective stylization capabilities. Current approaches rely on image-based conditioning which limits controllability and flexibility.

Method: A modular stylization architecture that supports multimodal conditioning (text and images) with minimal architectural modifications, integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones using 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.

Result: AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. User study confirms superior stylization quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AnyStyle enables pose-free, zero-shot 3D stylization with multimodal conditioning, offering better controllability and flexibility than existing methods while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.

*Panagiotis Mousouliotis,Georgios Keramidas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HW/SW co-design methodology using HLS for parameterized CNN accelerators on FPGAs that optimizes across multiple constraints (latency, power, area, cost) rather than just maximizing GOPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-life embedded DL applications have multiple constraints beyond just performance (GOPS), including latency, power consumption, area, and cost. Traditional FPGA CNN accelerators focus too narrowly on maximizing performance.

Method: Hardware-software co-design methodology using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools to describe CNN accelerators, enabling parameterization of the design for more effective multi-constraint optimization.

Result: The proposed design methodology outperforms non-parameterized design approaches and can be easily extended to other types of deep learning applications.

Conclusion: HLS-based HW/SW co-design with parameterization enables better optimization across multiple design constraints for embedded CNN accelerators on FPGAs, addressing real-world application requirements beyond just performance metrics.

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.

*Shikha Dubey,Patricia Raciti,Kristopher Standish,Albert Juan Ramon,Erik Ames Burlingame*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised framework using tissue masks and deformation metrics for fast, reliable registration quality assessment of histopathological whole slide images without ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating whole slide image registration are time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability in digital pathology.

Method: Jointly uses down-sampled tissue masks-based metrics (for global structural correspondence) and deformations-based metrics (for local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism) in an unsupervised framework.

Result: Validation shows strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments.

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable, real-time registration quality assessment with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight automated framework for detecting and removing artifacts in AFM images using classification, segmentation, and geometry-aware restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFM images suffer from artifacts caused by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions, degrading image quality and hindering accurate nanoscale surface analysis.

Method: Pipeline includes: 1) classification model to detect artifact presence, 2) lightweight semantic segmentation network for precise artifact masking, 3) adaptive mask expansion based on structural orientation, 4) directional neighbor-based interpolation for inpainting, 5) localized Gaussian smoothing for seamless restoration, integrated into user-friendly GUI with real-time parameter adjustment.

Result: Experimental results show effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing robust geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

Conclusion: The framework offers automated, geometry-aware artifact detection and restoration for AFM images, enabling improved data interpretation through preservation of structural details and user-friendly integration.

Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.

TL;DR: SeeingThroughClutter reconstructs 3D scenes from single images by iteratively removing and modeling objects using VLMs, improving performance in cluttered/occluded scenes without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on intermediate tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often fail in complex scenes with occlusion and clutter. There's a need for more robust 3D reconstruction from single images in challenging real-world conditions.

Method: An iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into simpler subtasks. Uses VLMs as orchestrators to detect, segment, remove, and 3D fit foreground objects one at a time. Removing objects enables cleaner segmentation of subsequent objects in occluded scenes.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets. The method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from advances in foundation models.

Conclusion: The iterative object removal approach enables more robust 3D reconstruction from single images in cluttered scenes by decomposing complex problems into simpler subtasks, leveraging foundation models without specialized training.

Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers introduce HPA10M, a large IHC image dataset, and iSight, an AI framework that outperforms pathologists in IHC assessment tasks and improves inter-pathologist agreement when used as an AI assistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI models for H&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to immunohistochemistry (IHC) is limited due to domain-specific variations in protein expression assessment, creating a need for specialized IHC AI systems.

Method: Created HPA10M dataset with 10.5M IHC images from Human Protein Atlas, then trained iSight using multi-task learning that combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through token-level attention to predict staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status.

Result: iSight achieved 85.5% accuracy for location, 76.6% for intensity, and 75.7% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models by 2.5-10.2%. In user studies, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments and improved inter-pathologist agreement (Cohen's κ increased from 0.63 to 0.70).

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and demonstrates the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance consistency and reliability of IHC assessment through expert-AI co-assessment.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $κ$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.

TL;DR: VideoBrain: An adaptive video understanding framework using dual agents (CLIP-based semantic retrieval + uniform temporal sampling) with behavior-aware rewards to efficiently process long videos with fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding is challenging due to computational constraints vs. need to capture information across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in single pass (no recovery from poor choices).

Method: End-to-end framework with dual complementary agents: CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across video and Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. Behavior-aware reward function with data classification pipeline teaches model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial.

Result: Achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames on four long video benchmarks. Shows strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoBrain enables efficient long-form video understanding through adaptive visual information acquisition with learned sampling policies, outperforming existing approaches while being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMS2F-HAD is a dual-branch Mamba-based model for hyperspectral anomaly detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.78% average AUC while being 4.6x faster than comparable deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for hyperspectral anomaly detection have limitations: CNNs fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies, while Transformers suffer from high computational costs. There's a need for efficient models that can handle noisy, unlabeled hyperspectral data while capturing both spatial and spectral features effectively.

Method: Proposes DMS2F-HAD, a dual-branch Mamba-based architecture that uses Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in separate branches, integrated through a dynamic gated fusion mechanism for enhanced anomaly localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78% across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, with inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.

Conclusion: DMS2F-HAD's combination of high performance and computational efficiency makes it a strong candidate for practical hyperspectral anomaly detection applications, addressing the limitations of both CNNs and Transformers in this domain.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Structure-from-Motion (SfM) performance in endoscopy videos by boosting feature extraction quality, as current methods struggle with feature detection and description in endoscopic environments.

Method: SuperPoint-E: a new local feature extraction method using Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy to enhance feature detection and description specifically for endoscopy.

Result: SuperPoint-E produces denser 3D reconstructions covering more and longer video segments, with features that fire more densely, have higher detection precision, and more discriminative descriptors that reduce need for guided matching.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves 3D reconstructions from endoscopy videos via SfM compared to original SuperPoint and COLMAP pipeline, demonstrating superior feature extraction for endoscopic applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on boosting the feature extraction to improve the performance of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in endoscopy videos. We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs need to analyze complex documents like flowcharts through QA interfaces, but creating large-scale datasets of flowchart images with corresponding text is time-consuming and challenging.

Method: Created JSynFlow dataset using LLMs to synthesize task descriptions for business occupations, generate flowchart images from domain-specific language code, and produce related QA pairs.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs with JSynFlow significantly improves performance on flowchart-based QA tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: JSynFlow provides a valuable resource for improving VLM performance on Japanese flowchart understanding, addressing the data scarcity problem through synthetic data generation using LLMs.

Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation architectures are benchmarked on single imaging modalities, hiding deployment-relevant performance variations. Researchers lack tools to select architectures for specific imaging setups or assess model trustworthiness on new samples in materials characterization.

Method: Developed a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation across SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Evaluated six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets to identify optimal architectures for different contexts.

Result: Optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations.

Conclusion: The framework addresses practical gaps in materials characterization by providing architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools to help researchers select appropriate architectures for specific imaging setups and assess model trustworthiness.

Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical imaging reconstruction with diffusion models faces challenges: 3D data collection is difficult and computationally expensive, so 2D priors are used instead. However, this leads to severe inter-slice discontinuities due to the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling. Existing regularization methods introduce sensitive hyperparameters and can cause over-smoothing.

Method: Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS) controls the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling. The key idea is to align sampling trajectories by making the noise consistent across slices, without adding new loss terms or optimization steps. It's plug-and-play and works with any 2D-trained diffusion-based 3D reconstruction pipeline.

Result: Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that ISCS effectively improves 3D imaging performance based on 2D diffusion models. The method achieves better inter-slice consistency without additional computational cost.

Conclusion: Controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practical approach for high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors. ISCS provides a simple yet effective solution to the inter-slice discontinuity problem in diffusion-based 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point2Insert is a sparse-point-based framework for precise object insertion in videos that uses only a few points instead of dense masks, offering flexible spatial control with positive/negative point guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: mask-based insertion requires labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle with precise location control. There's a need for accurate, low-effort object placement in videos.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage 1 trains an insertion model using sparse-point prompts or binary masks; Stage 2 adapts to video insertion using paired videos from an object removal model. Uses mask-guided teacher model to distill reliable insertion behavior into point-guided model.

Result: Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with 10x more parameters, demonstrating superior performance in flexible object insertion.

Conclusion: Point2Insert provides a user-friendly, flexible solution for precise object insertion in videos using sparse points instead of dense masks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient training.

Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.

*Yi-Kuan Hsieh,Jun-Wei Hsieh,Xin li,Ming-Ching Chang,Yu-Chee Tseng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISMamba introduces a rotation-robust scan order for Vision SSMs using concentric rings and partial channel filtering, achieving better accuracy, efficiency, and rotation invariance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision SSMs serialize 2D images into 1D sequences using predefined scan orders that break spatial adjacency and object continuity, making them vulnerable to geometric transformations like rotation. The scan order is an overlooked but critical factor affecting performance.

Method: PRISMamba partitions images into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through short radial SSMs. It also uses partial channel filtering to route only informative channels through the recurrent pathway while keeping others on a lightweight residual branch.

Result: Achieves 84.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s throughput on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. Maintains performance under rotation while fixed-path scans drop by 1-2%.

Conclusion: Scan-order design combined with channel filtering is a crucial, underexplored factor for achieving accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs, with PRISMamba demonstrating these benefits effectively.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to attention for vision tasks, offering lineartime sequence processing with competitive accuracy. Vision SSMs, however, require serializing 2D images into 1D token sequences along a predefined scan order, a factor often overlooked. We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%. These results highlight scan-order design, together with channel filtering, as a crucial, underexplored factor for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: HoloEv-Net: An efficient event-based action recognition framework using compact holographic spatiotemporal representation and global spectral gating to address computational, structural, and spectral redundancy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based action recognition methods suffer from three main problems: (1) computational redundancy from dense voxel representations, (2) structural redundancy in multi-branch architectures, and (3) under-utilization of spectral information for capturing global motion patterns.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR) that embeds horizontal spatial cues into Time-Height view to preserve 3D spatiotemporal contexts in 2D representation, addressing representation and structural redundancies. 2) Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module using Fast Fourier Transform for global token mixing in frequency domain to exploit spectral cues with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: HoloEv-Net-Base achieves SOTA on three benchmarks: THU-EACT-50-CHL (+10.29%), HARDVS (+1.71%), and DailyDVS-200 (+6.25%). HoloEv-Net-Small variant reduces parameters by 5.4×, FLOPs by 300×, and latency by 2.4× while maintaining competitive accuracy, demonstrating potential for edge deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed HoloEv-Net framework effectively addresses key redundancies in event-based action recognition through compact holographic representation and spectral gating, achieving superior performance with extreme efficiency for practical edge applications.

Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based driving framework, to use doScenes dataset's free-form instructions for instruction-conditioned trajectory planning, showing substantial improvements in driving behavior prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. The doScenes dataset provides real-world free-form instructions with ground-truth motion, enabling instruction-conditioned planning in real-world scenarios.

Method: Adapt OpenEMMA framework to integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within its vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. The system ingests front-camera views and ego-state, outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories.

Result: Instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures (98.7% reduction in mean ADE). Even without outliers, well-phrased prompts improve ADE by up to 5.1%. The analysis identifies characteristics of "good" instructions for the framework.

Conclusion: Instruction conditioning significantly improves trajectory planning performance, with proper phrasing of instructions providing measurable benefits. The work establishes a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning and releases evaluation prompts/scripts for community use.

Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiMo is a discrete diffusion framework that extends masked modeling to bidirectional text-motion understanding and generation, unifying T2M, M2T, and M2M in a single model with quality-latency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods focus mainly on text-to-motion, lacking bidirectional understanding and generation capabilities between text and motion.

Method: DiMo uses iterative masked token refinement with residual vector quantization (RVQ) for motion token fidelity and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for alignment and controllability.

Result: Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding, plus text-free motion completion, text-guided prediction, and caption correction capabilities.

Conclusion: DiMo demonstrates effective bidirectional text-motion understanding and generation within a unified framework, offering flexible inference trade-offs and multiple application capabilities.

Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.

*Hyeonjae Kim,Dongjin Kim,Eugene Jin,Tae Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework synthesizes authentic low-resolution images from single high-resolution images using flow matching in latent degradation space, enabling creation of large-scale real-world super-resolution training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning super-resolution methods perform well on synthetic degradations (like bicubic downsampling) but struggle with real-world images containing complex nonlinear degradations (noise, blur, compression artifacts). Existing approaches require painstaking collection of real LR-HR image pairs, which are limited to specific downscaling factors.

Method: The framework leverages latent degradation space with flow matching to synthesize authentic LR images from a single HR image. It generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, enabling creation of large-scale real-world SR training datasets.

Result: Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using these datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of real-world super-resolution by enabling scalable generation of realistic training data, leading to improved performance of SR models on real-world images with complex degradations.

Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.

*Feng Wang,Yichun Shi,Ceyuan Yang,Qiushan Guo,Jingxiang Sun,Alan Yuille,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTok is a unified video tokenization framework that decouples spatial and temporal representations using a key frame with residual tokens for subsequent frames, achieving more compact and expressive video encoding for both generation and understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language systems use naive frame-sampling strategies for video tokenization, which leads to inefficient representation where complexity scales with the product of frame count and per-frame tokens. There's a need for more compact yet expressive video tokenization that can handle both generation and understanding tasks efficiently.

Method: VTok decouples spatial and temporal representations by retaining full spatial features from a single key frame, while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token. This reduces representation complexity from product to sum of frame count and per-frame tokens, with residual tokens capturing viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame.

Result: VTok achieves 3.4% higher accuracy on TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score compared to naive tokenization baselines, with shorter token sequences per video. It produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation due to more consistent temporal encoding.

Conclusion: VTok provides an effective and efficient video tokenization framework that outperforms naive tokenization methods on both understanding and generation tasks, offering a standardized paradigm for future video research with its compact yet expressive representation.

Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.

TL;DR: AGMA introduces adaptive Gaussian mixture anchors to address prior misalignment in trajectory forecasting, achieving SOTA performance by constructing expressive scene-adaptive priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory forecasting approaches suffer from prior misalignment - their learned or fixed priors fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. The paper theoretically establishes that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck.

Method: AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors) constructs expressive priors through two stages: (1) extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data, and (2) distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. The method uses Gaussian mixture anchors that adapt to different scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that prior quality is a fundamental bottleneck in trajectory forecasting, and proposes AGMA as an effective solution that constructs adaptive, expressive priors to improve both accuracy and diversity of predictions.

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video autoencoders have three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents.

Method: Proposes One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA) with transformer-based framework: encoder uses query-based vision transformers with variable-length dropout for adaptive 1D encoding, decoder uses pixel-space diffusion transformer for reconstruction, with two-stage training strategy and additional regularization for generative modeling.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios, supports adaptive compression for higher compression ratios, and enables better downstream latent generation through regularization and decoder fine-tuning.

Conclusion: One-DVA successfully addresses key limitations of existing video autoencoders by providing adaptive compression, flexible architecture, and improved reconstruction quality through diffusion-based decoding, making it suitable for downstream generative tasks.

Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain MRI segmentation is crucial for medical analysis, but traditional CNNs like UNet struggle with uncertainty caused by partial volume effects and tissue ambiguity in brain images.

Method: Proposes IF-UNet, which integrates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet architecture. The model processes input data using membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees to better handle tissue ambiguity and boundary uncertainties.

Result: Evaluated on IBSR dataset using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU metrics. Experimental results show improved segmentation quality with better handling of uncertainty in brain images.

Conclusion: IF-UNet effectively addresses uncertainty in brain MRI segmentation by incorporating intuitionistic fuzzy logic, leading to enhanced segmentation performance compared to standard UNet approaches.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.

TL;DR: SPOT-Occ introduces a prototype-based sparse transformer decoder for efficient 3D occupancy prediction from cameras, using guided feature selection and focused aggregation instead of dense attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While sparse 3D representations solve encoding bottlenecks in autonomous vehicle perception, they create decoder challenges for efficiently aggregating information from sparse, non-uniform voxel features without computationally prohibitive dense attention.

Method: Proposes a Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder with two-stage process: 1) sparse prototype selection where each query adaptively identifies salient voxel features, and 2) focused feature aggregation. Uses complementary denoising paradigm with ground-truth masks for stable query-prototype association.

Result: SPOT-Occ outperforms previous methods with significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy for 3D occupancy prediction.

Conclusion: The prototype-guided sparse transformer decoder provides an efficient solution for 3D occupancy prediction, balancing accuracy and real-time performance for autonomous vehicle deployment.

Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.

*Aditya R. Bhattacharya,Debanjan Goswami,Shayok Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACIL is an active learning framework for class incremental learning that reduces annotation costs by selecting only the most informative samples for labeling in each episode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods require full annotation of all training samples in each episode, which is costly and wasteful since most samples become inaccessible in later episodes. There's a need to reduce annotation effort while maintaining performance.

Method: Proposes ACIL framework that uses uncertainty and diversity criteria to identify the most informative exemplar samples for annotation in each episode. These annotated samples are then appended to the data for the next episode.

Result: Extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets show that ACIL effectively reduces annotation costs while avoiding catastrophic forgetting, outperforming relevant baselines.

Conclusion: ACIL demonstrates that active learning can be successfully integrated with class incremental learning to significantly reduce annotation costs without compromising model performance, offering a practical solution for real-world continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.

TL;DR: Depth-guided framework for monocular video human mesh recovery that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through depth-guided fusion, metric-aware pose/shape estimation, and motion-depth aligned refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces challenges with metric consistency and temporal stability due to depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. Existing methods relying on RGB features and temporal smoothing struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities.

Method: Three synergistic components: 1) Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; 2) Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator using depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; 3) Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module enforcing temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues.

Result: Achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed depth-guided framework effectively addresses metric consistency and temporal stability issues in monocular video human mesh recovery, outperforming existing methods through synergistic integration of depth information with RGB features and temporal processing.

Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Yong Li,Yuanzhi Wang,Yi Ding,Shiqing Zhang,Ke Lu,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHMD is a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework that uses decoupled feature learning and hierarchical knowledge distillation to address modality heterogeneity and varying contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER approaches struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities, which limits their performance in emotion recognition tasks.

Method: Proposes Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD) that: 1) decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using self-regression; 2) employs two-stage knowledge distillation: coarse-grained KD via Graph Distillation Unit with dynamic graphs, and fine-grained KD through cross-modal dictionary matching for semantic alignment.

Result: DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3%/2.4% (ACC7), 1.3%/1.9% (ACC2) and 1.9%/1.8% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI datasets. Visualization shows meaningful distribution patterns in graph edges and dictionary activations.

Conclusion: The hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment, addressing key challenges in multimodal emotion recognition.

Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

### [43] [KVSmooth: Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Key-Value Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04268)
*Siyu Jiang,Feiyang Chen,Xiaojin Zhang,Kun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KVSmooth is a training-free method that reduces hallucination in Multimodal LLMs by applying attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing to hidden states during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucination (generating visually inconsistent content) due to semantic drift during decoding, which causes outputs to diverge from visual facts as sequence length increases. Existing methods often require expensive retraining or compromise between precision and recall.

Method: KVSmooth applies exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically adjusting smoothing strength based on the entropy of each token's attention distribution to quantify its "sink degree" (how much it attracts attention).

Result: Significantly reduces hallucination (CHAIR_S from 41.8 → 18.2) while improving overall performance (F1 score from 77.5 → 79.2), achieving simultaneous improvement in both precision and recall, unlike prior methods that trade off one for the other.

Conclusion: KVSmooth is an effective, general, and efficient training-free approach that mitigates hallucination in MLLMs during inference without requiring model retraining or modifications, addressing the semantic drift problem through adaptive smoothing of hidden states.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

TL;DR: SkeletonGaussian: A framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video using hierarchical articulated representation with skeleton-driven rigid motion and hexplane-based non-rigid refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D generation methods represent motion as implicit deformation fields, which limits direct control and editability. The authors aim to create a more interpretable and editable framework for dynamic 3D object generation.

Method: Proposes SkeletonGaussian with hierarchical articulated representation: 1) extracts robust skeleton, 2) drives rigid motion via linear blend skinning, 3) refines with hexplane-based non-rigid deformations. Uses 3D Gaussians representation for dynamic objects.

Result: SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses editability limitations in 4D generation by introducing explicit skeleton-driven motion representation combined with non-rigid refinement, offering both high-quality results and intuitive editing capabilities.

Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

TL;DR: A face fill-light enhancement method that brightens underexposed faces while preserving original scene illumination, using a large-scale dataset and physics-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face relighting methods often reshape overall lighting, which can suppress input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs.

Method: Introduces LightYourFace-160K dataset with physically consistent renderer, pretrains physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) to embed 6D parameters, then trains fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff) conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes.

Result: Demonstrates strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics on held-out paired sets while better preserving background illumination compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective solution for face fill-light enhancement that maintains scene consistency through physics-aware conditioning and diffusion modeling, with dataset and model publicly available.

Abstract: Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER is a training-free inference method that dynamically selects optimal layers for visual grounding in LVLMs based on query complexity, improving VQA accuracy across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed visual-token budgets in LVLMs force uniform image resizing, losing fine details and causing hallucinations. Current attention-guided enhancement methods use static "magic layers" chosen on simple benchmarks, which don't transfer well to complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Visual Activation by Query (VAQ) metric to identify optimal layers for query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity. Builds LASER - a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering based on query complexity.

Result: Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying complexity levels.

Conclusion: Visual grounding is dynamic - simple tasks use middle layers while complex tasks need deeper layer reactivation. LASER's adaptive layer selection effectively addresses limitations of static approaches and improves LVLM performance on diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JOintGS is a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from monocular RGB videos, achieving superior reconstruction quality and robustness to noisy initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos is challenging in unconstrained scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods are often inaccurate. Existing splatting methods (3DGS) depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: JOintGS jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations through synergistic refinement. Key innovations include: explicit foreground-background disentanglement for mutual reinforcement (static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation, refined cameras improve body alignment, optimized poses enhance scene reconstruction), a temporal dynamics module for fine-grained pose-dependent deformations, and a residual color field for illumination variations.

Result: Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets show JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. The method demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: JOintGS presents an effective unified framework for reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular videos, overcoming limitations of existing methods by jointly optimizing camera, pose, and scene representations, with demonstrated superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.

TL;DR: MSRL learns invariant representations from heterogeneous multiview data (features from different pretrained models) using self-representation learning and assignment probability distribution consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Features from different pretrained models have distinct distributions due to different pretraining objectives/architectures. Learning invariant representations from such heterogeneous multiview data in unsupervised transfer learning is challenging.

Method: Multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) with: 1) Individual linear models on frozen pretrained backbones, 2) Information-passing mechanism using self-representation learning for feature aggregation, 3) Assignment probability distribution consistency scheme to exploit complementary information across views and enforce representation invariance.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark visual datasets show MSRL consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MSRL effectively learns invariant representations from heterogeneous multiview data through self-representation learning and distribution consistency, with theoretical analysis supporting the approach.

Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large VLMs like CLIP to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised methods suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples.

Method: CoFT uses dual-prompt learning with positive/negative textual prompts to model pseudo-label cleanliness sample-dependently, avoiding thresholds. It employs two-phase training: parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples first, then full fine-tuning with collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. CoFT+ adds iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

Conclusion: CoFT provides an effective unsupervised adaptation framework for VLMs that handles noisy pseudo-labels through cross-modal collaboration and dual-prompt learning, achieving strong performance without labeled data.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-prompt tuning framework for active learning with CLIP, using positive and negative prompts to improve classification reliability and provide principled uncertainty signals for sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP to downstream tasks with limited annotation budgets is challenging. Existing active learning approaches for CLIP don't explicitly model uncertainty from the model perspective, relying instead on entropy-based criteria or representation clustering.

Method: Introduces a dual-prompt tuning framework with two learnable prompts in CLIP's textual branch: (1) Positive prompt enhances discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings aligned with light-weight tuned visual embeddings; (2) Negative prompt is trained in a reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that predicted labels are correct, providing uncertainty signals for active sample selection.

Result: Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms show the method consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches under the same annotation budget.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-prompt tuning framework provides a principled approach to uncertainty modeling for active CLIP adaptation, enabling more efficient sample selection and better performance with limited annotations.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of quickly onboarding novel objects for robotic interaction without extensive retraining or pre-processing. Current methods often require camera-specific parameters or target data retraining, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: 1) Encoder takes few RGB template views to generate sparse object-like point cloud using learned UDF (Unsigned Distance Function) with semantic/geometric info. 2) Decoder takes object encoding + query image to produce dense predictions (detection, segmentation, 6DoF pose). Single network handles multiple perception tasks.

Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing.

TL;DR: VecSet-Edit is the first pipeline using VecSet Large Reconstruction Model for direct 3D mesh editing, enabling precise region localization with 2D image conditions while preserving geometric and textural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D editing approaches focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, leaving direct mesh editing underexplored. Existing voxel-based methods like VoxHammer suffer from limited resolution and require labor-intensive 3D masks.

Method: 1) Analysis of VecSet token spatial properties revealing token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. 2) Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating for precise region localization using 2D image conditions. 3) Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during denoising. 4) Detail-preserving Texture Baking to preserve original mesh details.

Conclusion: VecSet-Edit represents a significant advancement in 3D mesh editing by leveraging VecSet LRM's capabilities, providing precise region control with 2D conditions while maintaining original mesh quality and texture details.

Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

*Jaehyun Kwak,Nam Cao,Boryeong Cho,Segyu Lee,Sumyeong Ahn,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGA is an attention-guided adversarial attack framework for LVLMs that progressively focuses perturbations on high-attention regions, achieving state-of-the-art attack success with minimal perceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on LVLMs using random cropping are inefficient and stochastic. The authors observed that regional attention scores correlate with adversarial loss sensitivity, and attacking high-attention regions causes structured attention redistribution, suggesting more efficient attack strategies.

Method: SAGA (Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack) progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. It uses attention scores to guide where to apply limited per-pixel perturbation budgets, attacking regions most sensitive to adversarial loss.

Result: SAGA consistently achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten different LVLMs while producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples through efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets.

Conclusion: Attention-guided regional attacks are more effective than global or random approaches for adversarial attacks on LVLMs. SAGA demonstrates that strategically targeting high-attention regions enables efficient use of perturbation budgets and exposes safety vulnerabilities in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparVAR is a training-free acceleration framework for Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) models that reduces computational complexity by exploiting attention patterns to enable sparse attention computation, achieving 1.57-2.28× speed-up while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from quartic computational complexity growth with resolution due to attention mechanisms, causing substantial latency. Existing acceleration methods skip high-resolution scales, which harms image quality by discarding high-frequency details.

Method: Exploits three VAR attention properties: (1) strong attention sinks, (2) cross-scale activation similarity, and (3) pronounced locality. Dynamically predicts sparse attention patterns from a sparse decision scale, constructs scale self-similar sparse attention via index-mapping, implements cross-scale local sparse attention with efficient block-wise sparse kernels.

Result: Reduces 1024×1024 image generation time to 1s for 8B model without skipping scales. Achieves 1.57× speed-up over FlashAttention-accelerated baseline while preserving high-frequency details. Combined with scale-skipping strategies, attains up to 2.28× acceleration with competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: SparVAR effectively accelerates VAR models by exploiting attention patterns for sparse computation, maintaining image quality while significantly reducing latency, making high-resolution VAR generation more practical.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

*Weihao Gao,Zhuo Deng,Zheng Gong,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraSeg family: Extremely lightweight (<0.3M params) polyp segmentation models optimized for CPU deployment in resource-constrained medical settings, achieving 90 FPS on single CPU core while maintaining >94% accuracy of 31M-parameter U-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-precision polyp segmentation models require GPUs, making them impractical for deployment in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, and capsule robots where computational resources are limited.

Method: Developed UltraSeg family with two variants: UltraSeg-108K for single-center data and UltraSeg-130K for multi-center, multi-modal images. Used joint optimization of encoder-decoder widths, constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and cross-layer lightweight fusion module.

Result: Models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core while retaining >94% of the Dice score of a 31M-parameter U-Net, using only 0.4% of its parameters. Evaluated on seven public datasets, establishing strong baseline for extreme-compression domain.

Conclusion: UltraSeg provides a clinically viable, CPU-native solution for colonoscopy polyp segmentation and offers a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.

*Yixin Zhu,Long Lv,Pingping Zhang,Xuehu Liu,Tongdan Tang,Feng Tian,Weibing Sun,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ISFM framework for multi-modal image fusion using interactive spatial-frequency fusion with Mamba architecture and multi-scale frequency integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods use simple serial/parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction, limiting effective integration of frequency information to enhance spatial features.

Method: ISFM framework with: 1) Modality-Specific Extractor using Mamba for long-range dependencies, 2) Multi-scale Frequency Fusion for adaptive low/high-frequency integration, 3) Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion where frequency guides spatial features across modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on six MMIF datasets show ISFM achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed interactive spatial-frequency fusion approach effectively combines frequency information to enhance spatial features, achieving superior multi-modal image fusion results.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCUDiff upgrades latent diffusion models from 4-channel to 16-channel latent space for better human-centric image restoration fidelity while maintaining one-step efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based restoration methods struggle with insufficient fidelity in human body restoration, where the VAE component becomes a bottleneck limiting restoration quality.

Method: Proposes LCUDiff framework with three key components: 1) Channel splitting distillation (CSD) for VAE fine-tuning to keep first 4 channels aligned with pre-trained priors while adding 12 channels for high-frequency details, 2) Prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to bridge mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and 16-channel latent space, 3) Decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations while preserving one-step efficiency.

Conclusion: LCUDiff successfully addresses VAE bottleneck in diffusion-based restoration, achieving better human-centric image restoration with improved fidelity and one-step efficiency through latent space expansion and adaptive routing.

Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

TL;DR: TrajVG is a 3D reconstruction framework that uses explicit 3D trajectory prediction to handle object motion in videos, overcoming limitations of existing feed-forward methods that degrade with multiple motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3D reconstruction models struggle with videos containing object motion. Global reference becomes ambiguous with multiple motions, while local pointmaps rely heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures.

Method: Proposes TrajVG framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. Couples sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (1) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (2) pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. Uses self-supervised training with pseudo 2D tracks to scale to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce.

Result: Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses current feed-forward performance baselines.

Conclusion: TrajVG effectively addresses motion-related degradation in 3D video reconstruction by making cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction through 3D trajectory estimation, achieving superior performance across multiple 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.

Conclusion: SynthVerse addresses critical data limitations in point tracking research by providing diverse, high-quality synthetic data that enables more robust training and evaluation, ultimately advancing progress toward general point tracking.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for segmentation are limited by their frozen internal knowledge, making them inadequate for real-world scenarios requiring up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts.

Method: Proposes Seg-ReSearch with interleaved reasoning and external search capabilities, trained using hierarchical reward design that balances initial guidance with progressive incentives to overcome sparse outcome signals vs rigid step-wise supervision dilemma.

Result: Seg-ReSearch substantially improves state-of-the-art approaches on the new OK-VOS benchmark (requiring outside knowledge for video object segmentation) and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Seg-ReSearch successfully overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing segmentation systems by enabling external search capabilities, demonstrating significant performance improvements on challenging benchmarks requiring outside knowledge.

Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

*Timothy Schaumlöffel,Arthur Aubret,Gemma Roig,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining central vision simulation and temporal slowness learning from human-like visual experience improves semantic object representation encoding, with central vision enhancing foreground object features and temporal slowness capturing broader semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans learn semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision, using high-resolution central vision and learning similar representations for temporally close inputs. This study investigates how central vision and slowness learning contribute to semantic object representation formation from natural visual experience.

Method: Simulated five months of human-like visual experience using Ego4D dataset, generated gaze coordinates with state-of-the-art gaze prediction model, extracted crops mimicking central vision, and trained a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on these crops.

Result: Combining temporal slowness and central vision improves encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Central vision strengthens foreground object feature extraction, while temporal slowness (especially during fixational eye movements) encodes broader semantic information about objects.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into how humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience, showing that both central vision focus and temporal slowness learning mechanisms play complementary roles in forming comprehensive object representations.

Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD-Pan is a sensor-agnostic latent diffusion method for pansharpening that achieves faster inference (2-3x speedup) and cross-sensor capability while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based pansharpening methods operate in pixel space, requiring separate models for different multispectral sensors, resulting in high latency and sensor-specific limitations.

Method: 1) Train band-wise single-channel VAE to encode HRMS into compact latent representations supporting various channel counts; 2) Inject spectral properties, PAN and MS images through unidirectional/bidirectional control structures; 3) Add lightweight cross-spectral attention module to diffusion model's central layer.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion methods on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 datasets, achieves 2-3x inference speedup, and demonstrates robust zero-shot cross-sensor capability.

Conclusion: SALAD-Pan provides an efficient, sensor-agnostic pansharpening solution with superior performance, faster inference, and cross-sensor generalization capability.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal LLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks due to progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which prevents them from fully exploiting test-time scaling capabilities.

Method: VaLR dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, aligning intermediate MLLM embeddings with vision encoder embeddings to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning.

Result: VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, showing test-time scaling behavior not seen in prior MLLMs. It achieves 19.9% improvement on VSI-Bench (33.0% to 52.9%) over Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: VaLR effectively addresses the visual information dilution problem in MLLMs, enabling better multi-step reasoning through vision-aligned latent tokens and demonstrating significant performance gains on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale mapping of informal settlements in developing countries is constrained by annotation scarcity, spectral ambiguity between formal/informal structures, and significant annotation noise in existing datasets.

Method: Introduces new benchmark datasets for Lahore, Karachi, and Mumbai (1,869 km² total). Proposes semi-supervised segmentation framework with: 1) Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding to dynamically adjust confidence thresholds and prevent minority class suppression, and 2) Prototype Bank System to enforce semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines across 8 cities spanning 3 continents. Demonstrates superior domain transfer: model trained on only 10% of source labels achieves 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies, outperforming zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses class imbalance and feature degradation in semi-supervised learning for informal settlement mapping, showing strong generalization across diverse geographical contexts with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.

*Cem Eteke,Enzo Tartaglione*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NiFi: Extreme 3DGS compression using artifact-aware diffusion-based one-step distillation for high-quality novel view rendering at ultra-low rates (down to 0.1 MB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables real-time novel view rendering but has high space requirements. Existing compression methods introduce artifacts at low rates, degrading visual quality significantly.

Method: NiFi uses artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation for extreme 3DGS compression, restoring quality from compressed representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates (down to 0.1 MB), with ~1000x rate improvement over original 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance.

Conclusion: NiFi enables extreme compression of 3DGS representations while maintaining high visual quality, making immersive applications more feasible through efficient storage and transmission.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DU-VLM is a vision-language model that unifies degradation understanding as hierarchical structured prediction, enabling accurate estimation of degradation types, parameters, and values through autoregressive token prediction, with applications in zero-shot image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description but fail to understand the parametric physics underlying image degradations, which is critical for computer vision applications like image restoration.

Method: Redefine degradation understanding as hierarchical structured prediction task; unify type, parameter key, and value estimation under autoregressive next-token prediction; introduce DU-VLM trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards; create DU-110k dataset with 110,000 clean-degraded pairs and physical annotations.

Result: DU-VLM significantly outperforms generalist baselines in accuracy and robustness, exhibits generalization to unseen distributions, and can serve as zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models to enable high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Degradation understanding can be effectively unified under a single autoregressive prediction paradigm, enabling accurate physical parameter estimation and practical applications in image restoration through zero-shot control of generative models.

Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.

*Gabriele Magrini,Federico Becattini,Niccolò Biondi,Pietro Pala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEPR framework uses event cameras as privileged info during training to make RGB models more robust to domain shifts like day-to-night changes, without losing semantic detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which is critical for real-world deployment under conditions different from training data. RGB models are semantically dense but domain-dependent, while event streams are sparse but more domain-invariant.

Method: Propose Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR) under learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm. Instead of direct feature alignment between RGB and event modalities, train RGB encoder to predict event-based latent features in a shared latent space, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness.

Result: The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: PEPR effectively leverages event cameras as privileged information during training to create more robust RGB models that maintain semantic richness while being more domain-invariant, addressing the critical domain generalization challenge for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.

Motivation: Saliency estimation is crucial for 360-degree video applications like viewport prediction and content optimization, but existing methods need improvement for better accuracy in immersive environments.

Method: Proposes SalFormer360 using transformer architecture: adapts SegFormer encoder (originally for 2D segmentation) to 360-degree content, adds custom decoder, and incorporates Viewing Center Bias to model user attention patterns in 360-degree environments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three largest benchmark datasets: achieves 8.4% higher Pearson Correlation Coefficient on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous best methods.

Conclusion: SalFormer360 demonstrates superior performance for 360-degree video saliency estimation through transformer-based architecture and viewing center bias integration, showing significant improvements over existing methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiplex imaging like IMC lacks a fixed channel space since real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating the core assumption of standard vision backbones that require fixed input channels.

Method: Introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling operation on arbitrary marker subsets without retraining.

Conclusion: ImmuVis is a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling that addresses the variable marker set challenge while maintaining performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.

### [74] [PIO-FVLM: Rethinking Training-Free Visual Token Reduction for VLM Acceleration from an Inference-Objective Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04657)
*Haokui Zhang,Congyang Ou,Dawei Yan,Peng Wang,Qingsen Yan,Ying Li,Rong Xiao,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIO-FVLM is a training-free visual token compression method for vision-language models that selects tokens based on their importance to preserving output invariance, achieving significant speedups with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accelerating VLM inference rely on heuristic approaches based on token similarity, which have limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. There's a need for a more principled approach that directly optimizes for preserving model output quality.

Method: PIO-FVLM transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance. It uses token-level gradient saliency from a layer-local proxy loss to reorder tokens, then selects the most valuable tokens following non-maximum suppression (NMS) principles. The method is training-free, compatible with FlashAttention, and can be deployed as encoder-free or combined with encoder compression approaches.

Result: On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens while maintaining 97.2% of original performance, achieving 2.67× prefill speedup, 2.11× inference speedup, 6.22× lower FLOPs, and 6.05× reduced KV Cache overhead.

Conclusion: PIO-FVLM provides an effective, practical approach for visual token compression in VLMs by focusing on preserving output invariance rather than relying on similarity heuristics, offering significant acceleration with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGILE: A robust framework that shifts from reconstruction to agentic generation for dynamic hand-object interaction learning, producing simulation-ready assets without relying on neural rendering or fragile SfM initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos face two major barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage.

Method: AGILE uses an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model guides a generative model to synthesize complete, watertight object meshes with high-fidelity texture. It bypasses fragile SfM with a robust anchor-and-track strategy: initializing object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model, then propagating it temporally. Finally, contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints for physical plausibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos show AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior methods frequently fail. The method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

Conclusion: AGILE successfully overcomes limitations of current methods by shifting from reconstruction to agentic generation, producing physically valid, simulation-ready hand-object interaction assets with superior robustness and geometric accuracy, enabling practical applications in robotics and VR.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), a new task that fuses RGB, Depth, and Language modalities for 3D-aware tracking, addressing limitations of existing 2D-only RMOT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets with complex spatial semantics (like "the person closest to the camera") and maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion due to lack of explicit 3D spatial information.

Method: The authors propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework that performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues.

Result: The paper introduces DRSet, a new RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset with 187 scenes, 240 language descriptions (56 with depth-related information), and extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRTrack framework.

Conclusion: The work establishes RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking as a novel task, provides a benchmark dataset (DRSet), and presents an effective framework (DRTrack) that leverages multi-modal fusion of RGB, depth, and language for improved 3D-aware tracking performance.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: Proposed annotation-free pipeline successfully leverages VLMs for space target detection/segmentation without manual labeling, demonstrating significant performance gains through pseudo-label distillation, making it valuable for space domain applications where annotation is difficult.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images make military vehicles appear indistinguishable, requiring better differentiation and identification methods. Existing SAR ATR research needs enhancement through contextual example retrieval.

Method: SAR-RAG combines multimodal large language model with vector database of semantic embeddings to retrieve similar past image examples with known true target types for comparison.

Result: Improved ATR prediction accuracy demonstrated through search/retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions compared to MLLM baseline.

Conclusion: SAR-RAG as an attached ATR memory bank enhances SAR target recognition by leveraging contextual search of past examples, showing measurable improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision method using 3D centroid constellations to match and track individual fruits across time for growth monitoring and orchard navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fruit size measurement is labor-intensive and non-scalable. While computer vision automates detection and counting, matching the same fruits across different time points remains unsolved, especially without fixed camera positions or GPS data.

Method: Proposes a new paradigm using constellations of 3D centroids with a descriptor for sparse 3D point clouds. Matches fruit constellations instead of individual fruits to handle non-rigidity, occlusions, and feature-poor imagery.

Result: Successfully matches fruits across videos and through time. Also enables building orchard maps and 6DoF camera pose localization for autonomous robot navigation and selective fruit picking.

Conclusion: The constellation-based approach effectively solves the fruit matching problem across time, enabling scalable growth tracking and practical applications in precision agriculture and autonomous orchard operations.

Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

TL;DR: A prompt-controlled diffusion framework generates synthetic remote-sensing images with controlled domain (Urban/Rural) and class ratios to address long-tailed pixel imbalance in semantic segmentation datasets like LoveDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery suffers from severe long-tailed pixel imbalance in training data, compounded by domain differences between Urban and Rural areas with distinct appearances and inconsistent class-frequency statistics.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage A uses domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion to generate layouts with user-specified class ratios while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance.

Result: Mixing synthetic ratio and domain-controlled pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization.

Conclusion: Controllable augmentation via prompt-controlled diffusion is a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation, addressing both class imbalance and domain differences.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

*Chengtao Lv,Yumeng Shi,Yushi Huang,Ruihao Gong,Shen Ren,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Light Forcing: First sparse attention solution for autoregressive video generation that addresses performance degradation through chunk-aware growth and hierarchical sparse attention, achieving significant speedups while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention solutions for bidirectional models don't work well for autoregressive video generation due to isolated chunk consideration and insufficient utilization of past context, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Light Forcing with two key components: 1) Chunk-Aware Growth mechanism that quantitatively estimates chunk contributions for sparsity allocation, enabling progressive sparsity increase and knowledge inheritance; 2) Hierarchical Sparse Attention with two-level mask selection (frame and block level) to capture informative historical and local context in coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (1.2-1.3× end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, achieves 2.3× speedup and 19.7 FPS on RTX 5090 GPU.

Conclusion: Light Forcing is the first effective sparse attention solution tailored for autoregressive video generation, addressing the quadratic complexity bottleneck while maintaining visual fidelity through intelligent sparsity allocation and hierarchical context utilization.

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.

*Qing'an Liu,Juntong Feng,Yuhao Wang,Xinzhe Han,Yujie Cheng,Yue Zhu,Haiwen Diao,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visualized text in images despite performing well on pure-text queries, revealing a significant modality gap that VISTA-Bench systematically evaluates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel at cross-modal understanding but are primarily tested on pure-text queries, while real-world scenarios often contain visualized text embedded in images. The paper aims to investigate whether VLMs handle visualized text comparably to pure text.

Method: The authors introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark spanning multimodal perception, reasoning, and unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by comparing model performance on pure-text versus visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions.

Result: Evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models performing well on pure-text queries degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. The gap amplifies with increased perceptual difficulty, showing sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics.

Conclusion: VISTA-Bench provides a principled framework to diagnose VLMs' limitations in handling visualized text and guides progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The benchmark highlights the need for improved handling of text embedded in images.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

### [83] [X2HDR: HDR Image Generation in a Perceptually Uniform Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04814)
*Ronghuan Wu,Wanchao Su,Kede Ma,Jing Liao,Rafał K. Mantiuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing LDR diffusion models can be adapted to HDR generation without retraining by using perceptually uniform encodings (PU21/PQ) instead of linear RGB, enabling both text-to-HDR synthesis and RAW-to-HDR reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR formats are becoming prevalent, but current image generators (like Stable Diffusion) are limited to LDR output due to lack of large-scale HDR training data. There's a need to adapt existing models to HDR without expensive retraining.

Method: Convert HDR inputs to perceptually uniform encodings (PU21/PQ) instead of linear RGB, freeze the pretrained VAE, and finetune only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in this perceptual space. This enables both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction.

Result: LDR-pretrained VAEs reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, while linear RGB causes severe degradations. The adaptation method improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range compared to previous techniques.

Conclusion: Existing diffusion models can be efficiently adapted to HDR generation by using perceptually uniform encodings, bridging the gap between LDR training data and HDR output without full retraining.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XtraLight-MedMamba is an ultra-lightweight deep learning framework using state-space models for classifying precancerous colon polyps from whole-slide images, achieving 97.18% accuracy with only 32K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk stratification of precancerous colon polyps relies on subjective histopathologic interpretation, which limits accurate assessment of low-grade dysplasia. There's a need for objective, automated methods to identify subtle morphological patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to human observers.

Method: Proposes XtraLight-MedMamba, a lightweight deep learning framework combining ConvNext-based shallow feature extraction with parallel vision Mamba to model long- and short-range dependencies. Includes Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) for multiscale feature extraction and Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) for parameter reduction and improved generalization.

Result: Achieved 97.18% accuracy and 0.9767 F1-score on a curated dataset of low-grade tubular adenomas, using only approximately 32,000 parameters. Outperformed transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures despite their significantly higher model complexity.

Conclusion: XtraLight-MedMamba demonstrates that ultra-lightweight state-space models can effectively classify precancerous colon polyps with high accuracy, offering a promising solution for objective risk stratification during colonoscopy screenings with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.

*Farzia Hossain,Samanta Ghosh,Shahida Begum,B. M. Shahria Alam,Mohammad Tahmid Noor,Md Parvez Mia,Nishat Tasnim Niloy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning model using InceptionV3 achieves 95.57% accuracy for automated classification of 6 nail disease types from 3,835 images, enhanced with adversarial training and SHAP explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of nail diseases is important as they can indicate underlying health problems, but challenging due to subtle visual differences between disease types. Current diagnosis relies heavily on clinical expertise, creating a need for automated support systems.

Method: Used a dataset of 3,835 nail images across 6 categories, resized to 224x224 pixels. Evaluated four CNN models (InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, ResNet50) with adversarial training to improve robustness against noisy images. Applied SHAP for model interpretability and feature importance visualization.

Result: InceptionV3 achieved the best performance with 95.57% accuracy, followed by DenseNet201 at 94.79%. Adversarial training improved model robustness, and SHAP provided interpretable feature importance for clinical understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed automated nail disease classification system shows high accuracy and robustness, with explainable AI features that could assist doctors in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, potentially serving as a valuable clinical support tool.

Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LitS is a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D/3D point clouds that uses piecewise constant functions on the unit circle to track surrounding points in different directions, enabling local geometry characterization and global structural understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, but practical analysis depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize local geometries of point clouds.

Method: LitS creates piecewise constant functions on the unit circle where each domain element represents a direction in a local reference system. Evaluating LitS at any direction gives information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region around that direction. It comes in two versions (regular and cumulative) with two parameters to adapt to various contexts and point cloud types.

Result: LitS conveys comprehensive information about local neighborhoods of points, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. It is resilient to common point cloud data issues like variable density and noise.

Conclusion: LitS is a versatile neighborhood descriptor capable of capturing nuances of local point arrangements, making it suitable for various applications across scientific and technological fields that work with 2D and 3D point cloud data.

Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.

*Soumya Jahagirdar,Walid Bousselham,Anna Kukleva,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask-LLaVA: A framework that combines multi-level visual features (mask-based object tokens, global tokens, and local patch tokens) to create compact visual representations for autoregressive VLMs, enabling dynamic token reduction at inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive VLMs use many visual tokens, increasing computational cost at inference. Need for more efficient token representation without sacrificing performance.

Method: Combine mask-based object representations with global tokens and local patch tokens. All tokens used during training, but model can flexibly drop mask-based object tokens at test time for adaptive token reduction.

Result: Competitive with current token-efficient methods and comparable to original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Enables dynamic token selection at test time with minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: Multi-level feature combination enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing flexible token reduction at inference without retraining, maintaining good performance.

Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

TL;DR: FlatDINO compresses DINOv2 patch features into 32 continuous tokens (8x sequence reduction, 48x dimensionality compression) for more efficient diffusion image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models using SSL patch features (like DINOv2) operate on dense patch grids with significant redundancy, making diffusion unnecessarily expensive in terms of computational cost.

Method: Introduces FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses DINOv2 patch representations into a 1D sequence of just 32 continuous tokens, achieving substantial compression (8x sequence length reduction, 48x total dimensionality compression).

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance, while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features.

Conclusion: FlatDINO enables efficient high-quality image generation by dramatically compressing patch representations while maintaining generation quality, though these are preliminary results and the work is still in progress.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.

*Jiahao Zhan,Zizhang Li,Hong-Xing Yu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerpetualWonder enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image by creating a closed-loop system with unified physical-visual representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail at long-horizon 4D scene generation because they decouple physical state from visual representation, preventing generative refinements from updating underlying physics for subsequent interactions.

Method: Introduces a true closed-loop system with novel unified representation linking physical state and visual primitives bidirectionally, plus a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity.

Result: From a single image, PerpetualWonder can simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions while maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

Conclusion: PerpetualWonder successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by creating a closed-loop system that enables physically plausible long-horizon 4D scene generation from single images.

Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

TL;DR: WarpFormer: A novel dense point tracker using warping instead of cost volumes, achieving SOTA performance on tracking benchmarks while also excelling at optical flow tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense point trackers rely on cost volumes which have quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. The paper aims to develop a more efficient approach that avoids this computational bottleneck.

Method: Proposes WarpFormer, which uses warping instead of cost volumes - iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from target frame to query frame based on current estimate. Combines this with a transformer architecture for joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, establishing long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks (TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, Robo-TAP). Remarkably, also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks.

Conclusion: Warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation, offering a simpler and more efficient alternative to cost volume-based approaches while maintaining or exceeding state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.
