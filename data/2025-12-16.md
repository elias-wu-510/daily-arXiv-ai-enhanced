*Ju-Young Kim,Ji-Hong Park,Myeongjun Kim,Gun-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model for smart farming that detects photometric perturbations and provides natural language explanations, improving action prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart farming systems using RGB cameras and robotic manipulators are vulnerable to photometric perturbations (hue, illumination, noise changes) that can cause malfunctions under adversarial attacks, creating a need for more robust and explainable systems.

Method: Developed an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on OpenVLA-OFT framework, integrating an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects.

Result: The proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses vulnerability to photometric perturbations in smart farming systems by combining adversarial robustness with explainability through natural language explanations, enhancing both performance and transparency.

Abstract: Smart farming has emerged as a key technology for advancing modern agriculture through automation and intelligent control. However, systems relying on RGB cameras for perception and robotic manipulators for control, common in smart farming, are vulnerable to photometric perturbations such as hue, illumination, and noise changes, which can cause malfunction under adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on the OpenVLA-OFT framework. The model integrates an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects. Experiments show that the proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to the baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions.

### [2] [Temporal-Anchor3DLane: Enhanced 3D Lane Detection with Multi-Task Losses and LSTM Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11869)
*D. Shainu Suhas,G. Rahul,K. Muni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal-Anchor3DLane enhances 3D lane detection with improved loss functions, lightweight temporal fusion, and training refinements, achieving +6.2 F1 improvement on OpenLane.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D lane detection faces challenges with depth ambiguity, occlusion, and temporal instability. While Anchor3DLane shows promise, it suffers from sensitivity to regression outliers, weak supervision of global curve geometry, difficulty balancing multiple loss terms, and limited temporal continuity exploitation.

Method: Three key enhancements: (1) Multi-task loss improvements including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting with focal and Dice components; (2) Lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module for cross-frame feature aggregation; (3) ESCOP-style training refinements coupling curve-level supervision with temporal consistency.

Result: On OpenLane dataset, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 score by +6.2 and produces smoother temporal trajectories, demonstrating significant robustness enhancement without requiring extra sensors or scaling.

Conclusion: Small architectural and loss refinements can significantly enhance 3D lane detection robustness, showing that careful design of loss functions and temporal fusion can overcome limitations of baseline models without additional hardware requirements.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection remains challenging due to depth ambiguity, occlusion, and temporal instability across frames. Anchor-based approaches such as Anchor3DLane have demonstrated strong performance by regressing continuous 3D lane curves from multi-camera surround views. However, the baseline model still exhibits (i) sensitivity to regression outliers, (ii) weak supervision of global curve geometry, (iii) difficulty in balancing multiple loss terms, and (iv) limited exploitation of temporal continuity. We propose Temporal-Anchor3DLane, an enhanced 3D lane detection framework that extends Anchor3DLane with three key contributions: (1) a set of multi-task loss improvements, including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting, together with focal and Dice components for classification and visibility; (2) a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module that aggregates per-anchor features across frames, replacing a heavier Transformer-style temporal fusion; and (3) ESCOP-style training refinements that couple curve-level supervision with temporal consistency. On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling.

*Tekleab G. Gebremedhin,Hailom S. Asegede,Bruh W. Tesheme,Tadesse B. Gebremichael,Kalayu G. Redae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed an offline crop disease detection system for Ethiopia's Tigray region, focusing on cactus-fig with three mobile-efficient models, achieving 90.7-97.3% accuracy for deployment on low-resource devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agriculture supports 80% of Tigray's population, but infrastructural disruptions limit access to expert crop disease diagnosis, creating need for offline-first detection systems for food security.

Method: Created indigenous cactus-fig dataset (3,587 field images, 3 symptom classes); benchmarked three mobile-efficient architectures: custom lightweight CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and MobileViT-XS; isolated cactus-fig performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer.

Result: EfficientNet-Lite1: 90.7% test accuracy; lightweight CNN: 89.5% accuracy with best deployment profile (42 ms latency, 4.8 MB size); MobileViT-XS: 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, showing MHSA-based global reasoning better disambiguates pest clusters from fungal lesions than CNN kernels.

Conclusion: Clear Pareto trade-off between accuracy and deployment efficiency; ARM-compatible models deployed in localized Flutter app for offline inference on Cortex-A53 devices, strengthening inclusivity for food security diagnostics in post-conflict edge environments.

Abstract: Agriculture supports over 80% of the population in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where infrastructural disruptions limit access to expert crop disease diagnosis. We present an offline-first detection system centered on a newly curated indigenous cactus-fig (Opuntia ficus-indica) dataset consisting of 3,587 field images across three core symptom classes. Given deployment constraints in post-conflict edge environments, we benchmark three mobile-efficient architectures: a custom lightweight CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and the CNN-Transformer hybrid MobileViT-XS. While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels. The ARM compatible models are deployed in a Tigrigna and Amharic localized Flutter application supporting fully offline inference on Cortex-A53 class devices, strengthening inclusivity for food security critical diagnostics.

This framework combines a two-stage hybrid training strategy with extensive data augmentation. Our core model is SegFormer with a Mix Transformer (MiT-B4) backbone. We employ an iterative teacher-student loop. This loop progressively refines model accuracy. It also maximizes data utilization. Our method achieved competitive performance. This was evident on both the Development and Testing Phase datasets.

### [5] [Generalization vs. Specialization: Evaluating Segment Anything Model (SAM3) Zero-Shot Segmentation Against Fine-Tuned YOLO Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11884)
*Ranjan Sapkota,Konstantinos I. Roumeliotis,Manoj Karkee,Nikolaos D. Tselikas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3 (zero-shot) vs YOLO11 (fine-tuned) on dense apple segmentation: YOLO has higher F1 scores at low IoU thresholds but degrades severely at higher IoU, while SAM3 maintains stable boundary precision across IoU ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively compare specialized fine-tuned models (YOLO variants) versus generalist foundation models (SAM3 in zero-shot mode) for dense instance segmentation tasks, specifically evaluating their performance under high object density and occlusion conditions.

Method: Evaluated SAM3 in pure zero-shot mode against three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation on the MinneApple dataset (670 orchard images with 28,179 apple instances). Used rigorous validation with different IoU thresholds to analyze performance gaps and boundary stability.

Result: At IoU=0.15, YOLO models achieved 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1 scores while SAM3 reached 59.8%. However, YOLO showed steep degradation (48-50 points) across IoU ranges while SAM3 dropped only 4 points, revealing SAM3 has 12 times superior boundary stability. IoU threshold choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%.

Conclusion: SAM3 excels in mask precision and boundary stability, while YOLO11 specializes in detection completeness. The study provides insights for choosing between specialized fine-tuned models vs generalist foundation models for dense instance segmentation, with open-source code and evaluation pipelines available.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced two fundamentally different paradigms for instance segmentation: specialized models optimized through task-specific fine-tuning and generalist foundation models capable of zero-shot segmentation. This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11. We provide open-source code, evaluation pipelines, and methodological recommendations, contributing to a deeper understanding of when specialized fine-tuned models or generalist foundation models are preferable for dense instance segmentation tasks.

*Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmWeaver: A framework using Implicit Neural Representations to synthesize realistic mmWave radar signals by conditioning on environmental context and human motion features, achieving high compression and faster generation than simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic mmWave signal generation is crucial for radar applications like activity recognition and pose estimation, but physical simulation is computationally expensive due to the complex, sparse, high-dimensional nature of mmWave signals.

Method: Uses Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model mmWave signals as continuous functions with hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (from RGB-D images) and human motion features (from MotionGPT text-to-pose generation).

Result: Achieves up to 49-fold compression, complex SSIM of 0.88, PSNR of 35 dB, 6-35x faster than simulation, improves activity recognition accuracy by 7%, and reduces pose estimation error by 15%.

Conclusion: mmWeaver enables efficient, realistic mmWave signal synthesis by leveraging semantic and geometric priors, making it practical for dataset augmentation and advancing radar-based applications.

Abstract: Realistic signal generation and dataset augmentation are essential for advancing mmWave radar applications such as activity recognition and pose estimation, which rely heavily on diverse, and environment-specific signal datasets. However, mmWave signals are inherently complex, sparse, and high-dimensional, making physical simulation computationally expensive. This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches.

*Tessa Vu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hot Hém is a GeoAI workflow that estimates pedestrian heat exposure in Ho Chi Minh City using Google Street View imagery, semantic segmentation, and remote sensing to enable heat-aware routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian heat exposure is a critical health risk in dense tropical cities, but standard routing algorithms ignore micro-scale thermal variations, creating a need for tools that can identify and operationalize heat exposure data for urban planning and public health.

Method: Combines Google Street View imagery, semantic image segmentation, and remote sensing. Two XGBoost models are trained to predict land surface temperature using GSV training data from selected administrative wards, then deployed across all OSMnx-derived pedestrian network nodes in a patchwork manner.

Result: Developed a spatial data science pipeline that can estimate pedestrian heat exposure across Ho Chi Minh City, enabling heat-aware routing and identifying city corridors with disproportionately higher temperatures at an infrastructural scale.

Conclusion: Hot Hém provides a foundation for pinpointing and understanding why certain urban corridors experience higher temperatures, offering a practical tool for urban planning and public health interventions in tropical cities.

Abstract: Pedestrian heat exposure is a critical health risk in dense tropical cities, yet standard routing algorithms often ignore micro-scale thermal variation. Hot Hém is a GeoAI workflow that estimates and operationalizes pedestrian heat exposure in Hô Chí Minh City (HCMC), Vi\d{e}t Nam, colloquially known as Sài Gòn. This spatial data science pipeline combines Google Street View (GSV) imagery, semantic image segmentation, and remote sensing. Two XGBoost models are trained to predict land surface temperature (LST) using a GSV training dataset in selected administrative wards, known as phŏng, and are deployed in a patchwork manner across all OSMnx-derived pedestrian network nodes to enable heat-aware routing. This is a model that, when deployed, can provide a foundation for pinpointing where and further understanding why certain city corridors may experience disproportionately higher temperatures at an infrastructural scale.

### [8] [Microscopic Vehicle Trajectory Datasets from UAV-collected Video for Heterogeneous, Area-Based Urban Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11898)
*Yawar Ali,K. Ramachandra Rao,Ashish Bhaskar,Niladri Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Openly available microscopic vehicle trajectory datasets collected via UAVs in heterogeneous urban traffic, providing high-resolution vehicle data for research applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional roadside video collection has limitations in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. There's a need for better data collection methods to capture complex urban traffic dynamics.

Method: Used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with top-down perspective to collect traffic data. Employed Data from Sky (DFS) platform for extraction. Collected data at six mid-block locations in India's national capital region with 30 FPS resolution, including vehicle positions, speeds, accelerations, and classifications.

Result: Created validated datasets with time-stamped vehicle trajectories, speeds, longitudinal/lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications. Data covers diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses revealed key behavioral patterns like lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral maneuvers.

Conclusion: These openly available UAV-collected datasets provide a valuable resource for global research community to support simulation modeling, safety assessment, and behavioral studies in complex urban traffic environments.

Abstract: This paper offers openly available microscopic vehicle trajectory (MVT) datasets collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in heterogeneous, area-based urban traffic conditions. Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions. By making these empirical datasets openly available, this work offers researchers a unique opportunity to develop, test, and validate models that more accurately represent complex urban traffic environments.

### [9] [Read or Ignore? A Unified Benchmark for Typographic-Attack Robustness and Text Recognition in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11899)
*Futa Waseda,Shojiro Yamabe,Daiki Shiono,Kento Sasaki,Tsubasa Takahashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIO-VQA, a new task for evaluating when vision-language models should read vs. ignore text in images, addressing limitations of current typographic attack defenses that encourage ignoring all text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs are vulnerable to typographic attacks, but existing defenses focus on object recognition and encourage ignoring all text, which fails in real-world scenarios requiring joint reasoning over both objects and text (like reading traffic signs while recognizing pedestrians).

Method: Introduces Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA) task and RIO-Bench dataset with real images and same-scene counterfactuals (read/ignore) by varying only textual content and question type. Also proposes a data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use.

Result: Strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability on RIO-Bench. The benchmark enables a novel adaptive defense that outperforms prior text-ignoring approaches.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental misalignment between existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs through adaptive selective text use rather than blanket text ignoring.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/.

*Santosh Patapati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARGA is a flexible multimodal fusion architecture that works with any number/type of modalities using attention-weighted graphs and GATs, achieving efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity and robustness to missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for a general-purpose multimodal fusion framework that can handle any number and type of modalities without architectural changes, adapt to different samples, handle missing modalities, and work across diverse tasks.

Method: Builds attention-weighted graphs over modality features per sample, uses multi-head Graph Attention Networks for message passing, includes learnable mask for missing modalities, and trains with hybrid supervised task loss + contrastive InfoNCE loss.

Result: Outperforms baselines and SOTA models across 7 diverse datasets spanning finance, HCI, multimedia classification, and affective computing; shows robustness to missing inputs and excels on niche tasks.

Conclusion: CLARGA provides an effective, efficient, and easily pluggable solution for multimodal representation learning across wide variety of tasks with flexibility for any modality combination.

Abstract: We introduce CLARGA, a general-purpose multimodal fusion architecture for multimodal representation learning that works with any number and type of modalities without changing the underlying framework. Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks. Overall, CLARGA can be easily plugged into machine learning models for effective and efficient learning of representations across a wide variety of tasks.

### [11] [Smartphone monitoring of smiling as a behavioral proxy of well-being in everyday life](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11905)
*Ming-Zher Poh,Shun Liao,Marco Andreetto,Daniel McDuff,Jonathan Wang,Paolo Di Achille,Jiang Wu,Yun Liu,Lawrence Cai,Eric Teasley,Mark Malhotra,Anupam Pathak,Shwetak Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Passive smartphone video analysis of candid smiles correlates strongly with established happiness measures, offering objective behavioral marker for well-being research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-report methods for measuring subjective well-being suffer from recall bias and high participant burden, creating a gap in understanding everyday well-being expressions.

Method: Analyzed 405,448 video clips from 233 participants over one week using deep learning to quantify smile intensity, examining diurnal/daily patterns and correlations with survey data and behavioral factors.

Result: Smile intensity patterns strongly correlated with national happiness surveys (r=0.92) and day reconstruction method results (r=0.80). Higher smile intensity associated with more physical activity and light exposure, but not smartphone use.

Conclusion: Passive smartphone sensing provides ecologically valid methodology for studying affective behavior dynamics and enables population-scale well-being research through objective behavioral correlates.

Abstract: Subjective well-being is a cornerstone of individual and societal health, yet its scientific measurement has traditionally relied on self-report methods prone to recall bias and high participant burden. This has left a gap in our understanding of well-being as it is expressed in everyday life. We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use. These findings suggest that passive smartphone sensing could serve as a powerful, ecologically valid methodology for studying the dynamics of affective behavior and open the door to understanding this behavior at a population scale.

*Noorul Wahab,Nasir Rajpoot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPath: A lightweight multimodal framework that generates pathology reports from whole slide images by conditioning a biomedical language model on visual embeddings through visual-prefix prompting, achieving 4th place in RED 2025 Grand Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated generation of diagnostic pathology reports from whole slide images is challenging due to large morphological variability and complex narrative structures. Current approaches struggle to translate high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text.

Method: MPath uses a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) conditioned on WSI-derived visual embeddings through learned visual-prefix prompting. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, it leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) injected into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency.

Result: MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The framework demonstrates competitive performance in pathology report generation.

Conclusion: Prompt-based multimodal conditioning represents a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation, showing potential for clinical applications while maintaining computational efficiency through lightweight architecture design.

Abstract: Automated generation of diagnostic pathology reports directly from whole slide images (WSIs) is an emerging direction in computational pathology. Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.

*Mozhgan Hadadi,Talukder Z. Jubery,Patrick S. Schnable,Arti Singh,Bedrich Benes,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Baskar Ganapathysubramanian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloraForge is an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, parametric 3D plant models using natural language, eliminating the need for extensive programming or geometric modeling expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D plant modeling approaches have significant limitations: learning-based methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability, while procedural modeling demands specialized geometric modeling expertise and understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists.

Method: FloraForge uses LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints. The framework allows iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR) and uses human-readable Plant Descriptor (PD) files for manual refinement.

Result: The framework successfully generates biologically accurate 3D plant models for maize, soybean, and mung bean by fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data. It produces dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and meshes with parametric metadata for quantitative analysis.

Conclusion: FloraForge democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science by combining LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations for both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD files, while maintaining mathematical rigor and compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows.

Abstract: Accurate 3D plant models are crucial for computational phenotyping and physics-based simulation; however, current approaches face significant limitations. Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object detection in autonomous driving struggles with sparse LiDAR points in distant regions, where existing densification strategies are insufficient. The paper aims to improve detection in sparse areas without increasing computational costs.

Method: Proposes TransBridge, a transformer-based up-sampling block that fuses features from detection and completion networks. Uses Dynamic-Static Reconstruction (DSRecon) module to generate dense LiDAR data for completion training. Leverages transformer mechanisms to establish channel and spatial relations for high-resolution feature maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Waymo datasets show consistent improvement in end-to-end 3D object detection, with mAP gains of 0.7-1.5 across multiple methods. For two-stage detection frameworks, boosts mAP up to 5.78 points, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: The joint completion-detection framework effectively addresses sparse point cloud challenges in 3D object detection, improving performance in distant regions while maintaining computational efficiency, with demonstrated generalization across different datasets and detection methods.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential in autonomous driving, providing vital information about moving objects and obstacles. Detecting objects in distant regions with only a few LiDAR points is still a challenge, and numerous strategies have been developed to address point cloud sparsity through densification.This paper presents a joint completion and detection framework that improves the detection feature in sparse areas while maintaining costs unchanged. Specifically, we propose TransBridge, a novel transformer-based up-sampling block that fuses the features from the detection and completion networks.The detection network can benefit from acquiring implicit completion features derived from the completion network. Additionally, we design the Dynamic-Static Reconstruction (DSRecon) module to produce dense LiDAR data for the completion network, meeting the requirement for dense point cloud ground truth.Furthermore, we employ the transformer mechanism to establish connections between channels and spatial relations, resulting in a high-resolution feature map used for completion purposes.Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.The results show that our framework consistently improves end-to-end 3D object detection, with the mean average precision (mAP) ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 across multiple methods, indicating its generalization ability. For the two-stage detection framework, it also boosts the mAP up to 5.78 points.

### [15] [MONET -- Virtual Cell Painting of Brightfield Images and Time Lapses Using Reference Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11928)
*Alexander Peysakhovich,William Berman,Joseph Rufo,Felix Wong,Maxwell Z. Wilson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MONET uses diffusion models to predict cell paint images from brightfield microscopy, enabling virtual cell painting without chemical fixation and allowing time-lapse studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cell painting is labor-intensive and requires chemical fixation, which prevents studying cell dynamics over time. There's a need for a non-invasive method to generate cell paint-like images.

Method: Train a diffusion model (MONET) on large datasets to predict cell paint channels from brightfield images. Use consistency architecture for time-lapse video generation and enable in-context learning for transfer to different cell lines and protocols.

Result: Model quality improves with scale. The architecture successfully generates time-lapse videos despite no video training data, and enables partial transfer to out-of-distribution cell lines and imaging protocols.

Conclusion: Virtual cell painting serves as a complementary tool to physical cell painting, enabling novel biological research workflows by overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Cell painting is a popular technique for creating human-interpretable, high-contrast images of cell morphology. There are two major issues with cell paint: (1) it is labor-intensive and (2) it requires chemical fixation, making the study of cell dynamics impossible. We train a diffusion model (Morphological Observation Neural Enhancement Tool, or MONET) on a large dataset to predict cell paint channels from brightfield images. We show that model quality improves with scale. The model uses a consistency architecture to generate time-lapse videos, despite the impossibility of obtaining cell paint video training data. In addition, we show that this architecture enables a form of in-context learning, allowing the model to partially transfer to out-of-distribution cell lines and imaging protocols. Virtual cell painting is not intended to replace physical cell painting completely, but to act as a complementary tool enabling novel workflows in biological research.

### [16] [Contextual Peano Scan and Fast Image Segmentation Using Hidden and Evidential Markov Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11939)
*Clément Fernandes,Wojciech Pieczynski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEMC-CPS, a new model combining contextual Peano scan with hidden evidential Markov chains for unsupervised Bayesian image segmentation, showing improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective unsupervised image segmentation method by combining the strengths of contextual Peano scan (which converts 2D images to 1D sequences) with hidden evidential Markov chains (which improve upon standard HMCs), enabling better modeling of complex images while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes HEMC-CPS model that integrates contextual Peano scan with hidden evidential Markov chains. Uses Bayesian maximum posterior mode segmentation with unsupervised parameter estimation via stochastic expectation-maximization (SEM) method.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness of HEMC-CPS for Bayesian MPM segmentation using both synthetic and real images. Shows potential for modeling complex images including 3D and multi-sensor multi-resolution images.

Conclusion: HEMC-CPS presents a promising approach for unsupervised image segmentation that combines computational efficiency with improved modeling capabilities, with potential applications beyond image segmentation to any spatially correlated data.

Abstract: Transforming bi-dimensional sets of image pixels into mono-dimensional sequences with a Peano scan (PS) is an established technique enabling the use of hidden Markov chains (HMCs) for unsupervised image segmentation. Related Bayesian segmentation methods can compete with hidden Markov fields (HMFs)-based ones and are much faster. PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC. We show its effectiveness for Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation using synthetic and real images. Segmentation is performed in an unsupervised manner, with parameters being estimated using the stochastic expectation--maximization (SEM) method. The new HEMC-CPS model presents potential for the modeling and segmentation of more complex images, such as three-dimensional or multi-sensor multi-resolution images. Finally, the HMC-CPS and HEMC-CPS models are not limited to image segmentation and could be used for any kind of spatially correlated data.

*Jingmin Zhu,Anqi Zhu,James Bailey,Jun Liu,Hossein Rahmani,Mohammed Bennamoun,Farid Boussaid,Qiuhong Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaPURLS is a novel framework for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition that establishes multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to bridge domain shift between seen and unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition approaches rely on coarse-grained alignment between skeleton features and static class-level semantics, which fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes and impedes transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge.

Method: 1) Uses large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions covering global movements and local body-part dynamics. 2) Adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. 3) Dynamic refinement module adapts textual features to incoming visual stream during inference via lightweight learnable projection. 4) Confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank stabilizes refinement and mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD datasets show DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art and sets new state-of-the-art records.

Conclusion: DynaPURLS successfully addresses limitations of coarse-grained alignment in zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition by establishing robust multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refining them at inference, enabling effective knowledge transfer to unseen classes.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZS-SAR) is fundamentally constrained by prevailing approaches that rely on aligning skeleton features with static, class-level semantics. This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models like DeiT show strong potential for semiconductor wafer defect detection and support predictive maintenance strategies in semiconductor fabrication.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance is an important sector in modern industries which improves fault detection and cost reduction processes. By using machine learning algorithms in the whole process, the defects detection process can be implemented smoothly. Semiconductor is a sensitive maintenance field that requires predictability in work. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG-19, Xception and Squeeze-Net have demonstrated solid performance in image classification for semiconductor wafer industry, their effectiveness often declines in scenarios with limited and imbalanced data. This study investigates the use of the Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) for classifying wafer map defects under data-constrained conditions. Experimental results reveal that the DeiT model achieves highest classification accuracy of 90.83%, outperforming CNN models such as VGG-19(65%), SqueezeNet(82%), Xception(66%) and Hybrid(67%). DeiT also demonstrated superior F1-score (90.78%) and faster training convergence, with enhanced robustness in detecting minority defect classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARI4D: First category-agnostic method for 4D human-object interaction reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, outperforming prior methods by 36-38% on reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 4D human-object interaction capture from single RGB cameras is important for human understanding, gaming, and robot learning, but current methods are limited by assumptions about object templates or constrained object categories.

Method: Proposes pose hypothesis selection algorithm that integrates foundation model predictions, joint refinement through learned render-and-compare paradigm for spatial/temporal/pixel alignment, and contact reasoning for physical constraint satisfaction.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in reconstruction error. Generalizes beyond training categories and works zero-shot on in-the-wild internet videos.

Conclusion: CARI4D enables category-agnostic, spatially and temporally consistent 4D human-object interaction reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, with strong generalization to unseen categories and real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate capture of human-object interaction from ubiquitous sensors like RGB cameras is important for applications in human understanding, gaming, and robot learning. However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error. Our model generalizes beyond the training categories and thus can be applied zero-shot to in-the-wild internet videos. Our code and pretrained models will be publicly released.

TL;DR: V-REX is an evaluation suite for assessing VLMs' multi-step visual reasoning through Chain-of-Questions approach, measuring planning and following capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex open-ended visual tasks requiring multi-step exploration and reasoning, but existing benchmarks focus on straightforward questions with specific targets. There's a need for evaluation methods that can assess intermediate reasoning steps in visual thinking paths.

Method: Developed V-REX evaluation suite with: (1) benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring multi-step exploration, (2) evaluation protocol using Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) approach, (3) finite options for questions and answers per step for reliable quantitative analysis, (4) disentanglement of planning (breaking down tasks) and following (answering curated CoQ) capabilities.

Result: Evaluation of SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs revealed: consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning.

Conclusion: V-REX provides a reliable framework for fine-grained analysis of VLMs' intermediate reasoning steps, enabling better understanding of their capabilities in complex visual reasoning tasks and highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: While many vision-language models (VLMs) are developed to answer well-defined, straightforward questions with highly specified targets, as in most benchmarks, they often struggle in practice with complex open-ended tasks, which usually require multiple rounds of exploration and reasoning in the visual space. Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning.

TL;DR: Semantic-Drive is a local-first neuro-symbolic framework for mining rare safety-critical events in AV video logs, achieving high recall and privacy preservation on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV development is bottlenecked by scarcity of "long-tail" safety-critical training data. Current solutions either lack precision (coarse metadata search) or are privacy-invasive/expensive (cloud-based VLMs). There's a need for precise, privacy-preserving semantic data mining.

Method: Two-stage neuro-symbolic approach: (1) Symbolic Grounding via real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, (2) Cognitive Analysis via Reasoning VLM for forensic scene analysis. Uses "System 2" inference-time alignment with multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus to mitigate hallucination.

Result: Achieves Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) on nuScenes dataset against Waymo Open Dataset taxonomy. Reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% compared to single models. Runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090).

Conclusion: Semantic-Drive provides an effective, privacy-preserving alternative to cloud-based solutions for mining rare safety-critical events in AV data, enabling better training data collection while addressing privacy and cost concerns.

Abstract: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\% compared to single models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mmWave radar point clouds for HAR suffer from sparsity and variable-size problems, and existing preprocessing methods from vision-based systems are not optimal for radar data.

Method: Proposed a graph representation with discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) using star graphs to capture spatial-temporal relationships between a static center point and dynamic radar points across frames.

Result: Achieved 94.27% classification accuracy on real-world HAR datasets, outperforming baseline methods and approaching vision-based skeleton data performance (97.25%). Demonstrated effective inference on Raspberry Pi 4.

Conclusion: The DDGNN with star graph representation effectively handles mmWave radar's sparsity and variable-size issues, achieving near-optimal performance without requiring resampling or frame aggregators, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) requires extracting accurate spatial-temporal features with human movements. A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design. Our system also outperformed three recent radar-specific methods without requiring resampling or frame aggregators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for privacy-preserving ship detection across diverse satellite datasets, especially for commercial imagery or sensitive annotations where data sharing is restricted.

Method: Evaluated four FL models (FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, FedMedian) using YOLOv8 ship detection, compared to local training baseline and global training with all data.

Result: FL models substantially improve detection accuracy over local training on smaller datasets and achieve performance close to global training with all data.

Conclusion: FL provides effective privacy-preserving solution for ship detection, with proper configuration of communication rounds and local epochs being crucial for optimal performance.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Federated Learning (FL) for ship detection across diverse satellite datasets, offering a privacy-preserving solution that eliminates the need for data sharing or centralized collection. This approach is particularly advantageous for handling commercial satellite imagery or sensitive ship annotations. Four FL models including FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and FedMedian, are evaluated and compared to a local training baseline, where the YOLOv8 ship detection model is independently trained on each dataset without sharing learned parameters. The results reveal that FL models substantially improve detection accuracy over training on smaller local datasets and achieve performance levels close to global training that uses all datasets during the training. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate FL configurations, such as the number of communication rounds and local training epochs, to optimize detection precision while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current burned area mapping approaches using computer vision models often overlook applicability to time-constrained emergency management scenarios, despite the crucial need for rapid damage assessment and ecosystem recovery support after wildfires.

Method: Supervised semantic segmentation workflow using SPOT-6/7 imagery, comparing U-Net and SegFormer models, incorporating land cover data as auxiliary task, and testing Test-Time Augmentation with optimization methods like Mixed Precision.

Result: U-Net and SegFormer perform similarly with limited training data, but SegFormer requires more resources. Land cover auxiliary task enhances robustness without increasing inference time. Test-Time Augmentation improves performance but increases inference time, which can be mitigated with Mixed Precision optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow balances performance and efficiency for emergency burned area delineation, with U-Net being more practical than SegFormer for resource-constrained scenarios, and auxiliary tasks and optimization methods providing valuable enhancements.

Abstract: After a wildfire, delineating burned areas (BAs) is crucial for quantifying damages and supporting ecosystem recovery. Current BA mapping approaches rely on computer vision models trained on post-event remote sensing imagery, but often overlook their applicability to time-constrained emergency management scenarios. This study introduces a supervised semantic segmentation workflow aimed at boosting both the performance and efficiency of BA delineation. It targets SPOT-6/7 imagery due to its very high resolution and on-demand availability. Experiments are evaluated based on Dice score, Intersection over Union, and inference time. The results show that U-Net and SegFormer models perform similarly with limited training data. However, SegFormer requires more resources, challenging its practical use in emergencies. Incorporating land cover data as an auxiliary task enhances model robustness without increasing inference time. Lastly, Test-Time Augmentation improves BA delineation performance but raises inference time, which can be mitigated with optimization methods like Mixed Precision.

### [25] [CreativeVR: Diffusion-Prior-Guided Approach for Structure and Motion Restoration in Generative and Real Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12060)
*Tejas Panambur,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Chongjian Ge,Ersin Yumer,Xue Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreativeVR is a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework that fixes severe structural and temporal artifacts in AI-generated and real videos through a precision-controlled deep-adapter approach with temporally coherent degradation training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models produce distorted faces/hands, warped backgrounds, and inconsistent motion, while traditional video restoration methods fail on these severe structural artifacts and diffusion-prior restorers lack control over quality-fidelity trade-offs.

Method: Uses deep-adapter-based diffusion-prior guidance with a single precision knob controlling input fidelity, trained with a novel temporally coherent degradation module that simulates realistic structural failures.

Result: Achieves SOTA on severe artifact restoration, competitive on standard benchmarks, runs at ~13 FPS at 720p on A100, and introduces AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic, and perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: CreativeVR effectively bridges the gap between precise restoration and structural correction for AI-generated and real videos with severe artifacts, offering practical throughput and controlled quality-fidelity trade-offs.

Abstract: Modern text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet they remain brittle at fine-scale structure: even state-of-the-art generators often produce distorted faces and hands, warped backgrounds, and temporally inconsistent motion. Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.
  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.
  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

*Ryan Po,Eric Ryan Chan,Changan Chen,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BAgger is a self-supervised training scheme that uses backward aggregation to teach autoregressive video models to recover from their own mistakes, reducing exposure bias and improving long-horizon video generation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video models suffer from exposure bias - training on clean contexts vs. inference on self-generated frames causes error compounding and quality drift over time. Existing approaches using few-step distillation and distribution-matching losses can hurt quality and diversity.

Method: Backwards Aggregation (BAgger) constructs corrective trajectories from the model's own rollouts, teaching it to recover from mistakes. It trains with standard score or flow matching objectives instead of few-step distillation, avoiding large teachers and long-chain backpropagation through time.

Result: BAgger instantiated on causal diffusion transformers shows more stable long-horizon motion, better visual consistency, and reduced drift in text-to-video, video extension, and multi-prompt generation tasks.

Conclusion: BAgger effectively addresses exposure bias in autoregressive video models through self-supervised corrective training, improving long-horizon generation quality without compromising diversity or requiring complex teacher models.

Abstract: Autoregressive video models are promising for world modeling via next-frame prediction, but they suffer from exposure bias: a mismatch between training on clean contexts and inference on self-generated frames, causing errors to compound and quality to drift over time. We introduce Backwards Aggregation (BAgger), a self-supervised scheme that constructs corrective trajectories from the model's own rollouts, teaching it to recover from its mistakes. Unlike prior approaches that rely on few-step distillation and distribution-matching losses, which can hurt quality and diversity, BAgger trains with standard score or flow matching objectives, avoiding large teachers and long-chain backpropagation through time. We instantiate BAgger on causal diffusion transformers and evaluate on text-to-video, video extension, and multi-prompt generation, observing more stable long-horizon motion and better visual consistency with reduced drift.

*Guanfang Dong,Luke Schultz,Negar Hassanpour,Chao Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RePack is a framework that compresses high-dimensional VFM features for Diffusion Transformers, accelerating convergence and improving image generation by filtering noise while preserving semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) enhance latent diffusion models, their high-dimensional representations can cause Information Overload, especially when VFM features exceed original image size, hindering efficient learning and generation.

Method: RePack transforms VFM representations into compact, decoder-friendly representations by projecting them onto low-dimensional manifolds, effectively filtering non-semantic noise while preserving core structural information needed for reconstruction.

Result: RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms methods that directly inject raw VFM features. On DiT-XL/2, it achieves FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, 35% faster than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RePack successfully extracts core semantics from VFM representations while avoiding high-dimensionality side effects, demonstrating that compact representation packing can effectively enhance diffusion transformers without information overload.

Abstract: The superior representation capability of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) has been harnessed for enhancing latent diffusion models (LDMs). These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects.

### [28] [VEGAS: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Vision-Encoder Attention Guided Adaptive Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12089)
*Zihu Wang,Boxun Xu,Yuxuan Xia,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEGAS: A simple inference-time method that reduces hallucinations in large vision-language models by injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's middle layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models often produce linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent outputs (hallucinations) with visual evidence. Current methods struggle to effectively suppress these hallucinations, and the key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding?

Method: VEGAS integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers during inference. The method adaptively steers tokens that fail to concentrate on key image objects. This approach is based on the finding that vision-text conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers, and injecting vision encoder attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations. The method shows that LVLMs hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, while the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations.

Conclusion: The vision encoder's own attention map is an effective form of visual attention for suppressing hallucinations during decoding. VEGAS provides a simple yet effective inference-time solution that leverages this insight to significantly reduce hallucinations in large vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive ability to jointly reason over visual and textual inputs. However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations.

### [29] [SPDMark: Selective Parameter Displacement for Robust Video Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12090)
*Samar Fares,Nurbek Tastan,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPDMark is a novel in-generation video watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by selectively displacing diffusion model parameters using LoRA-based basis shifts, enabling imperceptible, robust, and computationally efficient watermarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video watermarking methods fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. As high-quality video generation models proliferate, there's a critical need for reliable watermarking to detect and track generated video provenance.

Method: SPDMark uses selective parameter displacement of video diffusion models via additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts indexed by watermarking keys. It leverages LoRA for parameter efficiency, jointly trains basis shifts and watermark extractor with message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. Uses cryptographic hashing for frame-specific messages and maximum bipartite matching for temporal tamper recovery.

Result: SPDMark generates imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and demonstrates robustness against various common video modifications in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models.

Conclusion: SPDMark provides an effective framework for in-generation video watermarking that addresses the limitations of existing methods by achieving the desired balance of imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency through selective parameter displacement and LoRA-based implementation.

Abstract: The advent of high-quality video generation models has amplified the need for robust watermarking schemes that can be used to reliably detect and track the provenance of generated videos. Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.

TL;DR: Automated pollen recognition study comparing optical vs holographic microscopy, showing significant performance gap; GAN-based augmentation improves holographic detection by 7.25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automated pollen recognition in digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images, which suffer from speckle noise, twin-image artifacts, and appearance differences from conventional optical microscopy.

Method: Used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on dual-modality dataset. Applied Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images for data augmentation.

Result: Optical microscopy achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% classification accuracy, while DIHM only achieved 8.15% mAP50 and 50% accuracy. GAN-based augmentation improved DIHM detection to 15.4% mAP50 (7.25% improvement).

Conclusion: GAN-based data augmentation can reduce the performance gap between optical and holographic microscopy for automated pollen recognition, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging closer to practical application.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

TL;DR: EchoVLM: A vision-language model for echocardiography interpretation using novel pretraining objectives on a new measurement-grounded dataset (EchoGround-MIMIC), achieving SOTA performance across multiple clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography interpretation is labor-intensive and multimodal, requiring view recognition, measurements, qualitative assessments, and guideline reasoning. Current VLMs are limited in echocardiography due to lack of large-scale clinically grounded datasets and measurement-based reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created EchoGround-MIMIC dataset (19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients) with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and disease labels. Developed EchoVLM with two novel pretraining objectives: view-informed contrastive loss and negation-aware contrastive loss.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 36 tasks in 5 clinical applications: 86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification, 95.1% accuracy in view classification, plus strong results in image-text retrieval, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection.

Conclusion: Clinically grounded multimodal pretraining yields transferable visual representations. EchoVLM serves as a foundation model for end-to-end echocardiography interpretation. Dataset and code will be released for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Echocardiography is the most widely used imaging modality in cardiology, yet its interpretation remains labor-intensive and inherently multimodal, requiring view recognition, quantitative measurements, qualitative assessments, and guideline-based reasoning. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved broad success in natural images and certain medical domains, their potential in echocardiography has been limited by the lack of large-scale, clinically grounded image-text datasets and the absence of measurement-based reasoning central to echo interpretation. We introduce EchoGround-MIMIC, the first measurement-grounded multimodal echocardiography dataset, comprising 19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and guideline-derived disease labels. Building on this resource, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model that incorporates two novel pretraining objectives: (i) a view-informed contrastive loss that encodes the view-dependent structure of echocardiographic imaging, and (ii) a negation-aware contrastive loss that distinguishes clinically critical negative from positive findings. Across five types of clinical applications with 36 tasks spanning multimodal disease classification, image-text retrieval, view classification, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection, EchoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification). We demonstrate that clinically grounded multimodal pretraining yields transferable visual representations and establish EchoVLM as a foundation model for end-to-end echocardiography interpretation. We will release EchoGround-MIMIC and the data curation code, enabling reproducibility and further research in multimodal echocardiography interpretation.

TL;DR: A novel patch-based persistent homology approach for CT imaging outperforms traditional 3D cubical complex method in both accuracy and efficiency, with significant performance improvements across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D cubical complex filtration for persistent homology in CT imaging has limitations in performance and computational efficiency, especially with higher resolution images. There's a need for more effective topological feature extraction methods for medical imaging data.

Method: Proposes a patch-based persistent homology construction approach specifically designed for volumetric medical imaging data (CT modality). The method extracts topological features using persistent homology but organizes the data into patches rather than using the conventional 3D cubical complex filtration.

Result: The patch-based approach significantly outperforms the 3D cubical complex method, achieving average improvements of 10.38% in accuracy, 6.94% in AUC, 2.06% in sensitivity, 11.58% in specificity, and 8.51% in F1 score across all datasets. It also demonstrates better time-efficiency.

Conclusion: Patch-based persistent homology is a superior approach for topological feature extraction from CT images, offering both better classification performance and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. The authors provide a Python package (Patch-TDA) to facilitate adoption.

Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) models based on computed tomography (CT) imaging modality has been a major focus of recent research in the medical imaging domain. Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets. Finally, we provide a convenient python package, Patch-TDA, to facilitate the utilization of the proposed approach.

### [33] [A Benchmark Dataset for Spatially Aligned Road Damage Assessment in Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems Disaster Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12128)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Raisa Karnik,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Largest benchmark dataset for road damage assessment with 657.25km of labeled roads from 10 disasters, addressing limitations of prior datasets through operational validation and road line alignment corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior road damage assessment datasets are either too small, use low-resolution imagery, or lack operational validation, limiting their practical utility for emergency managers during disasters.

Method: Created CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset with 657.25km of roads labeled using 10-class schema, trained 18 baseline models, and deployed them operationally during Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Provided 9,184 road line adjustments to address spatial misalignment issues.

Result: Without spatial alignment, model performance degraded by 5.596% Macro IoU, with 8% (11km) of adverse conditions mislabeled and 9% (59km) of road lines misaligned off actual roads. Operational deployment validated the approach.

Conclusion: Spatial alignment is critical for accurate road damage assessment; ML/CV/robotics communities must address road line misalignment to enable effective disaster response decision-making.

Abstract: This paper presents the largest known benchmark dataset for road damage assessment and road alignment, and provides 18 baseline models trained on the CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset's post-disaster small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery from 10 federally declared disasters, addressing three challenges within prior post-disaster road damage assessment datasets. While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model fuses SAR, PMW, and DEM data to create high-resolution (100m daily) Greenland meltwater maps, achieving 95% accuracy vs. 83% for RCM-only and 72% for PMW-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current meltwater maps face trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution, limiting understanding of accelerated Greenland ice sheet melting processes that are hard to measure directly.

Method: Deep learning model spatiotemporally downscales regional climate model outputs using SAR, passive microwave, and DEM data over Helheim Glacier (2017-2023), with SAR-derived meltwater as ground truth.

Result: Deep learning fusion approach achieves 95% accuracy, outperforming RCM-only (83%) and PMW-only (72%) methods. Running window SAR method achieves 90% accuracy but underestimates extremes.

Conclusion: Deep learning data fusion enables high-resolution meltwater mapping, with published benchmark dataset (MeltwaterBench) for comparing downscaling methods, advancing ice sheet monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: The Greenland ice sheet is melting at an accelerated rate due to processes that are not fully understood and hard to measure. The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as "ground truth", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods. The code and data are available at $\href{https://github.com/blutjens/hrmelt}{github.com/blutjens/hrmelt}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world deployment requires models to recognize known categories while remaining reliable when novel classes appear, addressing the challenges of open-set recognition and few-shot class-incremental learning.

Method: For OSR: compared three pretrained frozen visual encoders (ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, CLIP ViT-B/16) using linear probe and four post-hoc scoring functions (MSP, Energy, Mahalanobis, kNN). For FSCIL: compared modified SPPR, OrCo, and ConCM methods using partially frozen ResNet-50 across 1-, 5-, and 10-shot scenarios.

Result: CLIP consistently yields strongest separability between known/unknown samples in OSR, with Energy providing most stable performance. For FSCIL, ConCM achieves 84.7% accuracy in 10-shot setting with cleanest confusion matrix, and all methods show saturation beyond 5 shots.

Conclusion: Controlled evaluation reveals how backbone architecture and scoring mechanisms affect unknown detection, and how prototype-based methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting during incremental adaptation in open-world scenarios.

Motivation: Visual methods for camera motion estimation struggle in visually degraded conditions (motion blur, occlusions). Passive scene sounds provide complementary cues that could improve robustness.

Method: Simple audio-visual framework integrating direction-of-arrival (DOA) spectra and binauralized embeddings into a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model.

Result: Consistent gains over strong visual baselines on two large datasets, plus robustness when visual information is corrupted. First work to successfully leverage audio for relative camera pose estimation in real-world videos.

Abstract: Understanding camera motion is a fundamental problem in embodied perception and 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods struggle to simultaneously preserve subject appearance from reference images and maintain motion patterns from reference videos due to lack of object-level guidance for both subject and motion.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) Use self-supervised encoder for subject representations to guide subject alignment, (2) Use optical flow encoder for motion representations to capture object-level motion trajectories, (3) Apply subject-motion association decoupling via sparse LoRA injection across locations and timing to reduce interference.

Result: Extensive experiments show SMRABooth excels in subject and motion customization, maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns, proving effectiveness in controllable text-to-video generation.

Conclusion: SMRABooth successfully addresses the challenge of customized video generation by providing object-level guidance for both subject and motion through specialized encoders and decoupled LoRA fine-tuning.

Abstract: Customized video generation aims to produce videos that faithfully preserve the subject's appearance from reference images while maintaining temporally consistent motion from reference videos. Existing methods struggle to ensure both subject appearance similarity and motion pattern consistency due to the lack of object-level guidance for subject and motion. To address this, we propose SMRABooth, which leverages the self-supervised encoder and optical flow encoder to provide object-level subject and motion representations. These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs. Extensive experiments show that SMRABooth excels in subject and motion customization, maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns, proving its effectiveness in controllable text-to-video generation.

Conclusion: The approach enables rapid field deployment with robust sensing and minimal communications for emergency reconnaissance applications in wildfire environments.

Abstract: This study introduces a lightweight perimeter tracking method designed for micro UAV teams operating over wildfire environments under limited bandwidth conditions. Thermal image frames generate coarse hot region masks through adaptive thresholding and morphological refinement, while RGB frames contribute edge cues and suppress texture related false detections using gradient based filtering. A rule level merging strategy selects boundary candidates and simplifies them via the Ramer Douglas Peucker algorithm. The system incorporates periodic beacons and an inertial feedback loop that maintains trajectory stability in the presence of GPS degradation. The guidance loop targets sub 50 ms latency on embedded System on Chip (SoC) platforms by constraining per frame pixel operations and precomputing gradient tables. Small scale simulations demonstrate reductions in average path length and boundary jitter compared to a pure edge tracking baseline, while maintaining environmental coverage measured through intersection merge analysis. Battery consumption and computational utilization confirm the feasibility of achieving 10, 15 m/s forward motion on standard micro platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALERT dataset and ISA-ViT framework for distracted driving detection using IR-UWB radar, achieving 22.68% accuracy improvement over existing ViT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distracted driving causes fatal crashes worldwide. Current IR-UWB radar-based DAR faces two main challenges: lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted behaviors, and difficulty adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.

Method: Proposes ISA-ViT (input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer) framework that resizes UWB data while preserving radar-specific information like Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. Uses patch configuration adjustments and pre-trained positional embedding vectors. Also employs domain fusion strategy combining range- and frequency-domain features.

Result: ISA-ViT achieves 22.68% accuracy improvement over existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. The ALERT dataset contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions.

Conclusion: By releasing ALERT dataset and detailing input-size-agnostic strategy, this work enables development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment, addressing key limitations in current radar-based DAR approaches.

Abstract: Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.
  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers significant promise for affective profiling of ASD children in clinical and therapeutic human-robot interaction contexts, contributing an essential foundation for future personalized assistive technologies.

Abstract: Understanding emotional responses in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during social interaction remains a critical challenge in both developmental psychology and human-robot interaction. This study presents a novel deep learning pipeline for emotion recognition in autistic children in response to a name-calling event by a humanoid robot (NAO), under controlled experimental settings. The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks. Emotions were probabilistically labeled using a weighted ensemble of two models: DeepFace's and FER, each contributing to soft-label generation across seven emotion classes. Final classification leveraged a fused embedding optimized via Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in modeling subtle affective responses and offers significant promise for affective profiling of ASD children in clinical and therapeutic human-robot interaction contexts, as the pipeline effectively captures micro emotional cues in neurodivergent children, addressing a major gap in autism-specific HRI research. This work represents the first such large-scale, real-world dataset and pipeline from India on autism-focused emotion analysis using social robotics, contributing an essential foundation for future personalized assistive technologies.

Conclusion: CineLOG addresses limitations in controllable video synthesis by providing a balanced, high-quality dataset and a novel pipeline that enables fine-grained cinematic control, advancing the field beyond basic textual prompt generation.

Abstract: Controllable video synthesis is a central challenge in computer vision, yet current models struggle with fine grained control beyond textual prompts, particularly for cinematic attributes like camera trajectory and genre. Existing datasets often suffer from severe data imbalance, noisy labels, or a significant simulation to real gap. To address this, we introduce CineLOG, a new dataset of 5,000 high quality, balanced, and uncut video clips. Each entry is annotated with a detailed scene description, explicit camera instructions based on a standard cinematic taxonomy, and genre label, ensuring balanced coverage across 17 diverse camera movements and 15 film genres. We also present our novel pipeline designed to create this dataset, which decouples the complex text to video (T2V) generation task into four easier stages with more mature technology. To enable coherent, multi shot sequences, we introduce a novel Trajectory Guided Transition Module that generates smooth spatio-temporal interpolation. Extensive human evaluations show that our pipeline significantly outperforms SOTA end to end T2V models in adhering to specific camera and screenplay instructions, while maintaining professional visual quality.

### [43] [Journey Before Destination: On the importance of Visual Faithfulness in Slow Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12218)
*Rheeya Uppaal,Phu Mon Htut,Min Bai,Nikolaos Pappas,Zheng Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to evaluate and improve visual faithfulness in reasoning chains of vision-language models, using step-level decomposition and self-reflection without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM reasoning evaluations only measure final-answer accuracy, missing two critical failure modes: (1) models reaching correct answers via visually unfaithful intermediate steps, and (2) reasoning faithfully yet failing on final predictions. There's a need to evaluate visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct dimension.

Method: Proposes a training- and reference-free framework that: (1) decomposes reasoning chains into perception vs. reasoning steps, (2) uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness evaluation, (3) validates through human meta-evaluation, and (4) introduces lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without training.

Result: Across multiple reasoning-trained VLMs and perception-heavy benchmarks, the method reduces Unfaithful Perception Rate while preserving final-answer accuracy, improving multimodal reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: Visual faithfulness of reasoning chains is a crucial evaluation dimension distinct from final-answer accuracy. The proposed framework enables better assessment and improvement of VLM reasoning reliability through step-level analysis and self-correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented vision language models (VLMs) generate explicit chains of thought that promise greater capability and transparency but also introduce new failure modes: models may reach correct answers via visually unfaithful intermediate steps, or reason faithfully yet fail on the final prediction. Standard evaluations that only measure final-answer accuracy cannot distinguish these behaviors. We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation. Building on this metric, we present a lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without any training. Across multiple reasoning-trained VLMs and perception-heavy benchmarks, our method reduces Unfaithful Perception Rate while preserving final-answer accuracy, improving the reliability of multimodal reasoning.

### [44] [Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Learning with Attribute-Centric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12219)
*Zhi Chen,Jingcai Guo,Taotao Cai,Yuxiang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACR framework uses mixture-of-experts to disentangle attributes for zero-shot fine-grained recognition, achieving SOTA on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attribute entanglement in conventional models collapses distinct attributes (color, shape, texture) into single visual embeddings, causing interference that masks critical distinctions for fine-grained recognition. Post-hoc solutions are insufficient as they operate on already mixed representations.

Method: Attribute-Centric Representations (ACR) framework with two mixture-of-experts components: 1) Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) with dual-level routing to dispatch image patches to specialized experts, ensuring coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts; 2) Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE) head that projects expert-refined features into sparse, part-aware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification.

Result: Achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN.

Conclusion: The proposed ACR framework effectively addresses attribute entanglement by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning, enabling better transfer of visual-attribute relationships from seen to unseen classes for fine-grained recognition.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen fine-grained categories demands a model that can distinguish subtle visual differences. This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts. This ensures coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts. Finally, the MoAE head projects these expert-refined features into sparse, partaware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification. On zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN, our ACR achieves consistent state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProImage-Bench: A rubric-based benchmark for evaluating professional image generation in scientific/technical domains, with automated evaluation and iterative refinement capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating scientifically precise, information-dense illustrations from technical descriptions, focusing more on visual plausibility than factual correctness. There's a need for rigorous evaluation of professional image generation capabilities.

Method: Created ProImage-Bench with 654 figures from real textbooks/technical reports across biology schematics, engineering drawings, and scientific diagrams. Developed detailed image instructions and hierarchical rubrics (6,076 criteria, 44,131 binary checks) derived using large multimodal models. Used automated LMM-based judge with principled penalty scheme for evaluation.

Result: Best base model achieved only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Failed checks used for iterative refinement boosted a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score.

Conclusion: ProImage-Bench provides both a rigorous diagnostic tool for professional image generation and a scalable supervision signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations through iterative refinement.

Abstract: We study professional image generation, where a model must synthesize information-dense, scientifically precise illustrations from technical descriptions rather than merely produce visually plausible pictures. To quantify the progress, we introduce ProImage-Bench, a rubric-based benchmark that targets biology schematics, engineering/patent drawings, and general scientific diagrams. For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations.

### [46] [Comparison of different segmentation algorithms on brain volume and fractal dimension in infant brain MRIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12222)
*Nathalie Alexander,Arnaud Gucciardi,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynthSeg outperforms SamSeg for infant brain MRI segmentation, providing more accurate volumetric and fractal dimension estimates, though segmentation uncertainty still affects FD analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant brain MRI segmentation is challenging due to ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast, but accurate segmentation is essential for quantifying developmental changes in structure and complexity.

Method: Systematic comparison of two segmentation methods (SynthSeg and SamSeg) using the Baby Open Brains dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, IoU, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. Also analyzed impact on volumetric and fractal dimension estimates.

Result: SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions). SynthSeg provided volumetric estimates closely matching manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]), while SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age. FD analyses showed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, with segmentation-related FD variability exceeding most group differences reported in developmental cohorts.

Conclusion: SynthSeg provides the most reliable volumetric and FD results for pediatric MRI, but small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted cautiously due to segmentation-related uncertainty. Segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation, as volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is essential for quantifying developmental changes in structure and complexity. However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty.

### [47] [Ultra-Low Bitrate Perceptual Image Compression with Shallow Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12229)
*Tianyu Zhang,Dong Liu,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEIC is a novel asymmetric image compression framework using shallow encoders and diffusion decoders for ultra-low bitrate (<0.05 bpp) scenarios, achieving high encoding efficiency (35.8 FPS on 1080P) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ultra-low bitrate compression methods rely on heavy pretrained encoders (VAEs, tokenizers) which are unsuitable for bandwidth-constrained edge devices with limited computational resources. There's a need for compression frameworks that maintain high reconstruction quality while being deployable on weak sender devices.

Method: AEIC employs moderate/shallow encoder networks with a one-step diffusion decoder. It uses a dual-side feature distillation scheme to transfer knowledge from moderate encoder variants to shallow encoder versions, enhancing efficiency while maintaining reconstruction fidelity at extreme bitrates.

Result: AEIC outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05 bpp), achieves exceptional encoding efficiency (35.8 FPS on 1080P images), and maintains competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AEIC framework successfully addresses the deployment challenges of ultra-low bitrate compression on edge devices by combining shallow encoders with diffusion decoders, achieving both encoding simplicity and high-quality reconstruction simultaneously.

Abstract: Ultra-low bitrate image compression (below 0.05 bits per pixel) is increasingly critical for bandwidth-constrained and computation-limited encoding scenarios such as edge devices. Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods.

### [48] [Moment and Highlight Detection via MLLM Frame Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12246)
*I Putu Andika Bagas Jiwanta,Ayu Purwarianti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method that applies segmentation objectives directly on LLM output tokens for video moment and highlight detection, using "0"/"1" character sequences as frame-level probabilities while leveraging LLM's language capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based and MLLM methods for video moment/highlight detection have limitations: text-based generation lacks direct gradients for frame-level predictions, and RL methods have their own issues. There's a need for a method that combines LLM reasoning with direct frame-level supervision.

Method: Feed LLM with fixed number of frames and prompt to output continuous "0"/"1" sequences (one character per frame). Use "0" as background and "1" as foreground probabilities. Train with segmentation losses on these probabilities alongside causal LM loss. At inference, use beam search to generate sequences (moments) and logits (saliency scores).

Result: Achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights with only 25 frames (less than half of comparable methods). Also scored above baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval. Segmentation losses provide stable complementary learning signal even when causal LM loss plateaus.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges LLM reasoning with frame-level supervision by treating LLM output tokens as segmentation probabilities, achieving efficient and effective video moment/highlight detection with minimal frame sampling.

Abstract: Detecting video moments and highlights from natural-language queries have been unified by transformer-based methods. Other works use generative Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to predict moments and/or highlights as text timestamps, utilizing its reasoning capability. While effective, text-based generation cannot provide direct gradients for frame-level predictions because the model only emits language tokens. Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous "0" and/or "1" characters, with one character per frame. The "0"/"1" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights. Additionally, our efficient method scores above the baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval. Empirically, segmentation losses provide a stable complementary learning signal even when the causal LM loss plateaus.

*Yuqing Lei,Yingjun Du,Yawen Huang,Xiantong Zhen,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaTPT is a meta-learning framework that learns self-supervised auxiliary tasks to guide test-time prompt tuning for vision-language models, improving domain adaptation through dynamic augmentation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP have strong zero-shot capabilities but remain sensitive to domain shifts at test time. Existing test-time prompt tuning methods use fixed augmentations that may fail in challenging settings.

Method: MetaTPT uses meta-learning with dual-loop optimization: inner loop learns self-supervised tasks that generate parameterized augmentations per sample, outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these learned augmentations.

Result: MetaTPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks, demonstrating improved test-time adaptation under domain shifts.

Conclusion: By coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning through meta-learning, MetaTPT enables more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains, enhancing test-time adaptation for vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization but remain sensitive to domain shifts at test time. Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) mitigates this issue by adapting prompts with fixed augmentations, which may falter in more challenging settings. In this work, we propose Meta Test-Time Prompt Tuning (MetaTPT), a meta-learning framework that learns a self-supervised auxiliary task to guide test-time prompt tuning. The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views. By coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning, MetaTPT improves test-time adaptation under domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaTPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks.

*Thibault Geoffroy,Myriam Maumy,Lionel Prevost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework for continual facial expression recognition using deep features and Action Units with Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems need emotion recognition for effective human-computer interaction, but facial expressions are dynamic and culturally nuanced, requiring continual learning models that don't forget prior knowledge.

Method: Hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) from FACS, modeled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs) for lightweight probabilistic continual learning.

Result: Model can learn basic expressions first and then progressively recognize compound expressions using CFEE dataset, demonstrating improved accuracy, stronger knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting.

Conclusion: The framework contributes to emotionally intelligent AI systems with applications in education, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces by enabling continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily life, the ability to recognize and adapt to human emotions is essential for effective human-computer interaction. Facial expression recognition (FER) provides a primary channel for inferring affective states, but the dynamic and culturally nuanced nature of emotions requires models that can learn continuously without forgetting prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The combined representation is modelled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs), which provide a lightweight, probabilistic solution that avoids retraining while offering strong discriminative power. Using the Compound Facial Expression of Emotion (CFEE) dataset, we show that our model can first learn basic expressions and then progressively recognize compound expressions. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, stronger knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting. This framework contributes to the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems with applications in education, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

*Jiahao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cognitive-YOLO: LLM-driven framework that generates object detection architectures directly from dataset characteristics using meta-feature analysis, RAG-augmented reasoning, and NADL compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual architecture design is labor-intensive, NAS is computationally expensive, and existing LLM approaches act as iterative optimizers rather than generating architectures from holistic data understanding.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Extract dataset meta-features (object scale distribution, scene density), 2) LLM reasons on features with RAG-retrieved components to synthesize architecture in NADL, 3) Compiler instantiates deployable model.

Result: Superior architectures generated across five diverse object detection datasets, achieving competitive performance and better performance-per-parameter trade-off than baselines.

Conclusion: Data-driven LLM reasoning is key to performance; understanding data "first principles" is more critical than simply retrieving SOTA components for superior architecture design.

Abstract: Designing high-performance object detection architectures is a complex task, where traditional manual design is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is computationally prohibitive. While recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often function as iterative optimizers within a search loop, rather than generating architectures directly from a holistic understanding of the data. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks. Crucially, our ablation studies prove that the LLM's data-driven reasoning is the primary driver of performance, demonstrating that a deep understanding of data "first principles" is more critical for achieving a superior architecture than simply retrieving SOTA components.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealDrag is the first comprehensive benchmark for point-based image editing with ground truth target images, featuring 400+ human-annotated samples and four novel metrics for objective evaluation of 17 SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drag-based image editing evaluation is unreliable due to lack of standardized benchmarks, inconsistent protocols, and absence of ground truth target images, making objective comparisons between methods difficult.

Method: Created RealDrag benchmark with 400+ human-annotated samples from diverse video sources, providing source/target images, handle/target points, editable region masks, and descriptive captions. Proposed four novel metrics: Semantical Distance (SeD), Outer Mask Preserving Score (OMPS), Inner Patch Preserving Score (IPPS), and Directional Similarity (DiS).

Result: Conducted first large-scale systematic analysis of the field by evaluating 17 state-of-the-art models using the benchmark, revealing clear trade-offs among current approaches and establishing a robust, reproducible baseline.

Conclusion: RealDrag provides the first comprehensive benchmark with ground truth for drag-based image editing, enabling objective evaluation and comparison of methods. The dataset and evaluation toolkit will be publicly available to guide future research.

Abstract: The evaluation of drag based image editing models is unreliable due to a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics. This ambiguity stems from inconsistent evaluation protocols and, critically, the absence of datasets containing ground truth target images, making objective comparisons between competing methods difficult. To address this, we introduce \textbf{RealDrag}, the first comprehensive benchmark for point based image editing that includes paired ground truth target images. Our dataset contains over 400 human annotated samples from diverse video sources, providing source/target images, handle/target points, editable region masks, and descriptive captions for both the image and the editing action.
  We also propose four novel, task specific metrics: Semantical Distance (SeD), Outer Mask Preserving Score (OMPS), Inner Patch Preserving Score (IPPS), and Directional Similarity (DiS). These metrics are designed to quantify pixel level matching fidelity, check preservation of non edited (out of mask) regions, and measure semantic alignment with the desired task. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large scale systematic analysis of the field, evaluating 17 SOTA models. Our results reveal clear trade offs among current approaches and establish a robust, reproducible baseline to guide future research. Our dataset and evaluation toolkit will be made publicly available.

### [53] [GrowTAS: Progressive Expansion from Small to Large Subnets for Efficient ViT Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12296)
*Hyunju Lee,Youngmin Oh,Jeimin Jeon,Donghyeon Baek,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GrowTAS is a progressive training framework for transformer architecture search that trains small subnets first and gradually incorporates larger ones to reduce interference and stabilize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer architecture search methods use weight-sharing supernets where all subnets share weights, causing severe interference that degrades smaller subnets. The authors found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones.

Method: Progressive training framework (GrowTAS) that begins with training small subnets and gradually incorporates larger ones to reduce interference. Also introduces GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes only a subset of weights to further enhance large subnet performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, CARS, INAT-19) demonstrate effectiveness over current TAS methods.

Conclusion: The progressive training approach reduces interference between subnets in transformer architecture search and stabilizes training, leading to better performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Transformer architecture search (TAS) aims to automatically discover efficient vision transformers (ViTs), reducing the need for manual design. Existing TAS methods typically train an over-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) that encompasses all candidate architectures (i.e., subnets). However, all subnets share the same set of weights, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and several transfer learning benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, CARS, and INAT-19, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over current TAS methods

TL;DR: Intention-Drive is the first benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems' ability to translate high-level human intentions into driving actions, revealing current models' limitations in understanding complex intentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems only follow low-level steering commands, lacking the ability to understand and fulfill high-level human intentions. There's no standardized benchmark to measure progress in this critical capability gap.

Method: Introduced Intention-Drive benchmark with two core components: (1) a dataset of complex driving scenarios paired with natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol using Intent Success Rate (ISR) that measures semantic fulfillment of human goals beyond geometric accuracy.

Result: Extensive evaluation of baseline models on Intention-Drive shows significant performance deficits - current models struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for translating high-level intentions into safe driving actions.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a crucial benchmark to drive progress toward genuinely intelligent autonomous driving that can understand and fulfill human intentions, highlighting the need for systems to evolve from command-followers to intention-fulfillers.

Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems operate at a level of intelligence akin to following simple steering commands. However, achieving genuinely intelligent autonomy requires a paradigm shift: moving from merely executing low-level instructions to understanding and fulfilling high-level, abstract human intentions. This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task.

*Yang Ou,Xiongwei Zhao,Xinye Yang,Yihan Wang,Yicheng Di,Rong Yuan,Xieyuanli Chen,Xu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMUDA is a hierarchical masking framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation that addresses cross-domain challenges through context-aware, feature distillation, and class decoupling masking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods struggle with cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise, limiting their ability to bridge domain gaps effectively.

Method: Proposes OMUDA with three hierarchical masking strategies: 1) Context-Aware Masking (CAM) to balance global context and local details, 2) Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) for robust feature learning via knowledge transfer from pre-trained models, and 3) Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) to mitigate noisy pseudo-labels by modeling class-wise uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments on SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes benchmarks show OMUDA achieves state-of-the-art results with average 7% improvement, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods.

Conclusion: OMUDA provides a unified hierarchical masking solution that effectively reduces domain shift at contextual, representational, and categorical levels, outperforming existing approaches in cross-domain semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables semantic segmentation models to generalize from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%.

### [56] [MRD: Using Physically Based Differentiable Rendering to Probe Vision Models for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12307)
*Benjamin Beilharz,Thomas S. A. Wallis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRD uses differentiable rendering to find 3D scenes that produce identical neural activations in vision models, probing their implicit 3D understanding through physically grounded metamers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep vision models lack interpretability, and while they're assumed to develop implicit 3D scene understanding, there's no direct way to test this. Current evaluation methods don't ground results in physical scene descriptions.

Method: MRD uses physically based differentiable rendering to find 3D scene parameters (geometry/shape and BRDF/material) that produce the same model activation as target scenes. It optimizes for model metamers - physically different scenes that yield identical neural responses.

Result: Models show high similarity in activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual reconstruction results. The approach successfully probes model sensitivity to specific physical attributes like shape while holding other factors constant.

Conclusion: MRD provides a physically grounded framework for analyzing vision models' implicit 3D understanding, enabling investigation of which scene attributes drive model responses and advancing interpretability for both computer and human vision research.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeDetect is a family of open-vocabulary object detection models using retrieval philosophy that achieves SOTA performance, enables fast historical data backtracking, and integrates with LMMs for referring expression comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient open-vocabulary object detection systems that leverage retrieval-based approaches for faster inference and greater versatility compared to cross-modal fusion methods.

Method: Dual-tower architecture without cross-modal fusion layers, treating recognition as retrieval in shared embedding space. Includes three variants: WeDetect (base detector), WeDetect-Uni (universal proposal generator), and WeDetect-Ref (LMM-based classifier for complex referring expressions).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 benchmarks with real-time inference. Enables object retrieval in historical data and handles complex referring expressions efficiently.

Conclusion: The WeDetect family successfully unifies detection, proposal generation, object retrieval, and referring expression comprehension under a coherent retrieval framework, demonstrating superior efficiency and versatility over fusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection aims to detect arbitrary classes via text prompts. Methods without cross-modal fusion layers (non-fusion) offer faster inference by treating recognition as a retrieval problem, \ie, matching regions to text queries in a shared embedding space. In this work, we fully explore this retrieval philosophy and demonstrate its unique advantages in efficiency and versatility through a model family named WeDetect: (1) State-of-the-art performance. WeDetect is a real-time detector with a dual-tower architecture. We show that, with well-curated data and full training, the non-fusion WeDetect surpasses other fusion models and establishes a strong open-vocabulary foundation. (2) Fast backtrack of historical data. WeDetect-Uni is a universal proposal generator based on WeDetect. We freeze the entire detector and only finetune an objectness prompt to retrieve generic object proposals across categories. Importantly, the proposal embeddings are class-specific and enable a new application, object retrieval, supporting retrieval objects in historical data. (3) Integration with LMMs for referring expression comprehension (REC). We further propose WeDetect-Ref, an LMM-based object classifier to handle complex referring expressions, which retrieves target objects from the proposal list extracted by WeDetect-Uni. It discards next-token prediction and classifies objects in a single forward pass. Together, the WeDetect family unifies detection, proposal generation, object retrieval, and REC under a coherent retrieval framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 benchmarks with high inference efficiency.

TL;DR: UniCoDe is a universal algorithm that unifies sampling-based and gradient-guided methods for aligning diffusion models with downstream objectives, improving sampling efficiency while maintaining reward alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models have limitations: sampling-based methods are inefficient for complex rewards, while gradient-guided methods rely on differentiable reward approximations. There's a need to combine both strategies for better performance.

Method: UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, creating a unified framework that brings together the strengths of both sampling-based and gradient-guided methods. This addresses sampling inefficiency while maintaining effective reward alignment.

Result: Empirical results show UniCoDe remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across various tasks, offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior.

Conclusion: UniCoDe successfully unifies sampling and gradient-based guidance for diffusion model alignment, enabling more efficient sampling while maintaining competitive performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion model outputs with downstream objectives is essential for improving task-specific performance. Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior. Empirical results demonstrate that UniCoDe remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across a range of tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/maurya-goyal10/UniCoDe

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCLeaf-Net is a transformer-convolution hybrid detector for real-field foliar disease detection, using a novel dataset (Daylily-Leaf) and achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-field foliar disease detection faces challenges from cluttered backgrounds, domain shifts, and limited lesion-level datasets, hindering robust modeling for timely crop protection.

Method: Proposes TCLeaf-Net with three key components: 1) Transformer-convolution module (TCM) to suppress non-leaf regions, 2) Raw-scale feature recalling and sampling (RSFRS) to preserve spatial detail, and 3) Deformable alignment block with FPN (DFPN) for multi-scale fusion.

Result: On Daylily-Leaf dataset, achieves 78.2% mAP@50 (5.4% improvement), reduces computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU memory by 8.7%, outperforms YOLO/RT-DETR series, and shows strong generalization on PlantDoc, Tomato-Leaf, and Rice-Leaf datasets.

Conclusion: TCLeaf-Net effectively addresses real-field challenges in foliar disease detection through hybrid architecture design and demonstrates robust performance and generalizability across multiple plant disease datasets.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of foliar diseases is vital for safeguarding crop growth and reducing yield losses. Yet, in real-field conditions, cluttered backgrounds, domain shifts, and limited lesion-level datasets hinder robust modeling. To address these challenges, we release Daylily-Leaf, a paired lesion-level dataset comprising 1,746 RGB images and 7,839 lesions captured under both ideal and in-field conditions, and propose TCLeaf-Net, a transformer-convolution hybrid detector optimized for real-field use. TCLeaf-Net is designed to tackle three major challenges. To mitigate interference from complex backgrounds, the transformer-convolution module (TCM) couples global context with locality-preserving convolution to suppress non-leaf regions. To reduce information loss during downsampling, the raw-scale feature recalling and sampling (RSFRS) block combines bilinear resampling and convolution to preserve fine spatial detail. To handle variations in lesion scale and feature shifts, the deformable alignment block with FPN (DFPN) employs offset-based alignment and multi-receptive-field perception to strengthen multi-scale fusion. Experimental results show that on the in-field split of the Daylily-Leaf dataset, TCLeaf-Net improves mAP@50 by 5.4 percentage points over the baseline model, reaching 78.2\%, while reducing computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU memory usage by 8.7\%. Moreover, the model outperforms recent YOLO and RT-DETR series in both precision and recall, and demonstrates strong performance on the PlantDoc, Tomato-Leaf, and Rice-Leaf datasets, validating its robustness and generalizability to other plant disease detection scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoARM introduces an agentic reasoning-over-hierarchical-memory paradigm for long-form video understanding that adaptively processes videos through observation-thinking-action-memorization loops, reducing token consumption while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-form video understanding methods rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or token-consuming preprocessing, which are inefficient for extended temporal structures and dense multimodal cues in videos.

Method: VideoARM uses an adaptive agentic reasoning system with a controller that autonomously invokes tools for coarse-to-fine video interpretation, combined with hierarchical multimodal memory that continuously captures and updates multi-level clues to support decision-making.

Result: VideoARM outperforms state-of-the-art method DVD on prevalent benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.

Conclusion: The agentic reasoning-over-hierarchical-memory paradigm provides an effective solution for long-form video understanding by enabling adaptive, on-the-fly processing rather than static preprocessing, achieving better performance with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging due to the extended temporal structure and dense multimodal cues. Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.

TL;DR: STAGE introduces a storyboard-anchored workflow for multi-shot video generation using structural storyboards instead of sparse keyframes, with techniques for cross-shot consistency and cinematic transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current keyframe-based video generation methods struggle with maintaining cross-shot consistency and capturing cinematic language, despite offering better control than end-to-end approaches.

Method: STAGE uses STEP2 to predict structural storyboards (start-end frame pairs per shot), multi-shot memory packs for entity consistency, dual-encoding for intra-shot coherence, and two-stage training for cinematic transitions.

Result: STAGE achieves superior performance in structured narrative control and cross-shot coherence, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The storyboard-anchored approach with structural storyboards and specialized techniques effectively addresses multi-shot video generation challenges while maintaining cinematic quality and consistency.

Abstract: While recent advancements in generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity in video synthesis, creating coherent multi-shot narratives remains a significant challenge. To address this, keyframe-based approaches have emerged as a promising alternative to computationally intensive end-to-end methods, offering the advantages of fine-grained control and greater efficiency. However, these methods often fail to maintain cross-shot consistency and capture cinematic language. In this paper, we introduce STAGE, a SToryboard-Anchored GEneration workflow to reformulate the keyframe-based multi-shot video generation task. Instead of using sparse keyframes, we propose STEP2 to predict a structural storyboard composed of start-end frame pairs for each shot. We introduce the multi-shot memory pack to ensure long-range entity consistency, the dual-encoding strategy for intra-shot coherence, and the two-stage training scheme to learn cinematic inter-shot transition. We also contribute the large-scale ConStoryBoard dataset, including high-quality movie clips with fine-grained annotations for story progression, cinematic attributes, and human preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAGE achieves superior performance in structured narrative control and cross-shot coherence.

TL;DR: V-Warper is a training-free coarse-to-fine framework for video personalization that enhances identity fidelity without video training, using lightweight image adaptation and inference-time appearance injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video personalization methods require heavy video-based finetuning or large-scale video datasets, which are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. They also struggle with maintaining fine-grained appearance consistency across frames.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Coarse appearance adaptation using only reference images with image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation. (2) Inference-time fine appearance injection using semantic correspondences from RoPE-free mid-layer query-key features to warp appearance-rich value representations into semantically aligned regions with masking for spatial reliability.

Result: V-Warper significantly improves appearance fidelity while preserving prompt alignment and motion dynamics, achieving these gains efficiently without large-scale video finetuning.

Conclusion: V-Warper provides an effective training-free solution for video personalization that addresses computational cost and scalability issues while enhancing fine-grained identity consistency across frames.

Abstract: Video personalization aims to generate videos that faithfully reflect a user-provided subject while following a text prompt. However, existing approaches often rely on heavy video-based finetuning or large-scale video datasets, which impose substantial computational cost and are difficult to scale. Furthermore, they still struggle to maintain fine-grained appearance consistency across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce V-Warper, a training-free coarse-to-fine personalization framework for transformer-based video diffusion models. The framework enhances fine-grained identity fidelity without requiring any additional video training. (1) A lightweight coarse appearance adaptation stage leverages only a small set of reference images, which are already required for the task. This step encodes global subject identity through image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation. (2) A inference-time fine appearance injection stage refines visual fidelity by computing semantic correspondences from RoPE-free mid-layer query--key features. These correspondences guide the warping of appearance-rich value representations into semantically aligned regions of the generation process, with masking ensuring spatial reliability. V-Warper significantly improves appearance fidelity while preserving prompt alignment and motion dynamics, and it achieves these gains efficiently without large-scale video finetuning.

Conclusion: M4Human advances HMR research by providing a large-scale multimodal benchmark that addresses limitations of vision-based sensing and current radar datasets, enabling research across different levels of RF signal granularity and multimodal fusion approaches.

Abstract: Human mesh reconstruction (HMR) provides direct insights into body-environment interaction, which enables various immersive applications. While existing large-scale HMR datasets rely heavily on line-of-sight RGB input, vision-based sensing is limited by occlusion, lighting variation, and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, recent efforts have explored radio-frequency (RF) mmWave radar for privacy-preserving indoor human sensing. However, current radar datasets are constrained by sparse skeleton labels, limited scale, and simple in-place actions. To advance the HMR research community, we introduce M4Human, the current largest-scale (661K-frame) ($9\times$ prior largest) multimodal benchmark, featuring high-resolution mmWave radar, RGB, and depth data. M4Human provides both raw radar tensors (RT) and processed radar point clouds (RPC) to enable research across different levels of RF signal granularity. M4Human includes high-quality motion capture (MoCap) annotations with 3D meshes and global trajectories, and spans 20 subjects and 50 diverse actions, including in-place, sit-in-place, and free-space sports or rehabilitation movements. We establish benchmarks on both RT and RPC modalities, as well as multimodal fusion with RGB-D modalities. Extensive results highlight the significance of M4Human for radar-based human modeling while revealing persistent challenges under fast, unconstrained motion. The dataset and code will be released after the paper publication.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved the training efficiency of diffusion transformers. However, these techniques have largely been studied in isolation, leaving unexplored the potential synergies from combining multiple approaches. We present SR-DiT (Speedrun Diffusion Transformer), a framework that systematically integrates token routing, architectural improvements, and training modifications on top of representation alignment.

To our knowledge, this is a state-of the-art result at this model size. Through extensive ablation studies, we identify which technique combinations are most effective and document both synergies and incompatibilities. We release our framework as a computationally accessible baseline for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for articulated assets often produce ambiguous or unrealistic kinematic structures due to entanglement between geometric shape and joint dynamics, especially when using single-view inputs of closed states.

Method: ArtGen uses cross-state Monte Carlo sampling for global kinematic consistency, Chain-of-Thought reasoning for structural priors, sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer for kinematic interactions, and compositional 3D-VAE with local-global attention for geometry and part relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on PartNet-Mobility benchmark show ArtGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating articulated 3D objects.

Conclusion: ArtGen effectively addresses structural-motion entanglement in articulated object generation, producing accurate geometry and coherent kinematics from single-view inputs.

Abstract: Generating articulated assets is crucial for robotics, digital twins, and embodied intelligence. Existing generative models often rely on single-view inputs representing closed states, resulting in ambiguous or unrealistic kinematic structures due to the entanglement between geometric shape and joint dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtGen, a conditional diffusion-based framework capable of generating articulated 3D objects with accurate geometry and coherent kinematics from single-view images or text descriptions at arbitrary part-level states. Specifically, ArtGen employs cross-state Monte Carlo sampling to explicitly enforce global kinematic consistency, reducing structural-motion entanglement. Additionally, we integrate a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module to infer robust structural priors, such as part semantics, joint types, and connectivity, guiding a sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer to specialize in diverse kinematic interactions. Furthermore, a compositional 3D-VAE latent prior enhanced with local-global attention effectively captures fine-grained geometry and global part-level relationships. Extensive experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that ArtGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical beam dropout in spinning LiDAR sensors (caused by hardware aging, dust, snow, fog, or bright reflections) removes entire vertical slices from point clouds, severely degrading 3D perception for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Represents each LiDAR sweep as an unstructured spatial graph where points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving beam-index ordering. Uses multi-layer Graph Attention Network (GAT) to learn adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regress missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations.

Result: Trained/evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout: average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, 87.98% of reconstructed points within 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on single GPU. Reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k.

Conclusion: Pure graph attention model operating solely on raw point-cloud geometry can effectively recover dropped vertical beams under realistic sensor degradation, without requiring camera images or temporal information.

Abstract: Vertical beam dropout in spinning LiDAR sensors triggered by hardware aging, dust, snow, fog, or bright reflections removes entire vertical slices from the point cloud and severely degrades 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k. These results show that a pure graph attention model operating solely on raw point-cloud geometry can effectively recover dropped vertical beams under realistic sensor degradation.

*Tue-Thu Van-Dinh,Hoang-Duy Tran,Truong-Binh Duong,Mai-Hanh Pham,Binh-Nam Le-Nguyen,Quoc-Thai Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViInfographicVQA is the first Vietnamese benchmark for Infographic Visual Question Answering, featuring 6747 infographics and 20409 QA pairs across various domains, with both single-image and novel multi-image reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to evaluate models' ability to understand data-rich infographics in Vietnamese, which requires stronger integration of OCR, layout understanding, and reasoning compared to standard VQA tasks. Current benchmarks lack Vietnamese infographic evaluation and cross-image reasoning assessment.

Method: Created ViInfographicVQA benchmark with 6747 real-world infographics and 20409 human-verified question-answer pairs across economics, healthcare, education, etc. Includes two evaluation settings: Single-image (traditional VQA) and Multi-image (novel cross-image reasoning requiring evidence synthesis across multiple related infographics).

Result: Evaluation of recent vision-language models revealed substantial performance disparities, with most significant errors occurring on Multi-image questions involving cross-image integration and non-span reasoning. The benchmark provides baseline results for Vietnamese InfographicVQA.

Conclusion: ViInfographicVQA contributes the first Vietnamese benchmark for infographic understanding and highlights limitations of current multimodal models in low-resource contexts, particularly in layout-aware and cross-image reasoning, encouraging future research in these areas.

Abstract: Infographic Visual Question Answering (InfographicVQA) evaluates a model's ability to read and reason over data-rich, layout-heavy visuals that combine text, charts, icons, and design elements. Compared with scene-text or natural-image VQA, infographics require stronger integration of OCR, layout understanding, and numerical and semantic reasoning. We introduce ViInfographicVQA, the first benchmark for Vietnamese InfographicVQA, comprising over 6747 real-world infographics and 20409 human-verified question-answer pairs across economics, healthcare, education, and more. The benchmark includes two evaluation settings. The Single-image task follows the traditional setup in which each question is answered using a single infographic. The Multi-image task requires synthesizing evidence across multiple semantically related infographics and is, to our knowledge, the first Vietnamese evaluation of cross-image reasoning in VQA. We evaluate a range of recent vision-language models on this benchmark, revealing substantial performance disparities, with the most significant errors occurring on Multi-image questions that involve cross-image integration and non-span reasoning. ViInfographicVQA contributes benchmark results for Vietnamese InfographicVQA and sheds light on the limitations of current multimodal models in low-resource contexts, encouraging future exploration of layout-aware and cross-image reasoning methods.

### [68] [BokehDepth: Enhancing Monocular Depth Estimation through Bokeh Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12425)
*Hangwei Zhang,Armando Teles Fortes,Tianyi Wei,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BokehDepth is a two-stage framework that uses defocus as a geometric cue to improve both bokeh rendering and monocular depth estimation by decoupling bokeh synthesis from depth prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods don't fully exploit the connection between bokeh and depth estimation. Bokeh rendering suffers from noisy depth maps, while depth models struggle with ambiguous regions where defocus cues could help.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Physically guided controllable bokeh generator produces depth-free bokeh stacks from sharp input; 2) Lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module fuses features along defocus dimension to enhance existing depth encoders.

Result: Improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts metric accuracy and robustness of monocular depth foundation models across challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Treating defocus as auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue enables better bokeh synthesis and depth estimation by decoupling the two tasks while leveraging their inherent connection.

Abstract: Bokeh and monocular depth estimation are tightly coupled through the same lens imaging geometry, yet current methods exploit this connection in incomplete ways. High-quality bokeh rendering pipelines typically depend on noisy depth maps, which amplify estimation errors into visible artifacts, while modern monocular metric depth models still struggle on weakly textured, distant and geometrically ambiguous regions where defocus cues are most informative. We introduce BokehDepth, a two-stage framework that decouples bokeh synthesis from depth prediction and treats defocus as an auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue. In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models.

TL;DR: GPF (Gaussian Photon Field) accelerates multi-view rendering by learning a continuous radiance function from photon distributions, eliminating redundant photon tracing for each viewpoint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photon mapping is computationally inefficient for multi-view rendering due to redundant photon tracing and kernel estimation for each viewpoint, despite providing physically accurate global illumination effects like caustics.

Method: Reformulate photon mapping as a continuous, reusable radiance function using Gaussian Photon Field (GPF) - learnable anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum, initialized from physically traced photons and optimized with multi-view radiance supervision.

Result: GPF achieves photon-level accuracy for complex light transport (caustics, specular-diffuse interactions) while reducing computation by orders of magnitude compared to traditional photon mapping.

Conclusion: GPF unifies physical rigor of photon-based rendering with efficiency of neural scene representations, enabling differentiable radiance evaluation without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement.

Abstract: Accurately modeling light transport is essential for realistic image synthesis. Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PeRL-VL improves RLVR-trained VLMs by decoupling visual perception and textual reasoning training, using description rewards for better visual extraction and reasoning SFT for logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR-trained VLMs still suffer from inaccurate visual extraction (missing/hallucinating details) and logically inconsistent chains-of-thought because verifiable signals only supervise final answers, not intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: PeRL-VL decouples training into two components: 1) Perception: uses VLM-based description reward to score model's self-generated image descriptions for faithfulness and sufficiency; 2) Reasoning: adds text-only Reasoning SFT stage on logic-rich chain-of-thought data to enhance coherence independently of vision.

Result: Improves average Pass@1 accuracy from 63.3% (base Qwen2.5-VL-7B) to 68.8% across diverse multimodal benchmarks, outperforming standard RLVR, text-only reasoning SFT, and naive multimodal distillation from GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception and reasoning training addresses persistent failure modes in RLVR-trained VLMs, leading to more accurate visual extraction and logically consistent reasoning chains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently been extended from text-only LLMs to vision-language models (VLMs) to elicit long-chain multimodal reasoning. However, RLVR-trained VLMs still exhibit two persistent failure modes: inaccurate visual extraction (missing or hallucinating details) and logically inconsistent chains-of-thought, largely because verifiable signals supervise only the final answer. We propose PeRL-VL (Perception and Reasoning Learning for Vision-Language Models), a decoupled framework that separately improves visual perception and textual reasoning on top of RLVR. For perception, PeRL-VL introduces a VLM-based description reward that scores the model's self-generated image descriptions for faithfulness and sufficiency. For reasoning, PeRL-VL adds a text-only Reasoning SFT stage on logic-rich chain-of-thought data, enhancing coherence and logical consistency independently of vision. Across diverse multimodal benchmarks, PeRL-VL improves average Pass@1 accuracy from 63.3% (base Qwen2.5-VL-7B) to 68.8%, outperforming standard RLVR, text-only reasoning SFT, and naive multimodal distillation from GPT-4o.

TL;DR: AdaptiveDetector: A two-stage detector-verifier framework using YOLOv11 with VLM-guided adaptive confidence thresholds and GRPO fine-tuning to improve polyp detection under adverse clinical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp detectors trained on clean datasets underperform in real-world endoscopy due to illumination changes, motion blur, and occlusions. Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between laboratory conditions and clinical practice with adverse imaging conditions.

Method: Two-stage detector-verifier framework: 1) YOLOv11 detector with adaptive per-frame confidence thresholds guided by vision-language model (VLM), 2) VLM verifier fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function to discourage missed detections. Also created synthetic testbed by degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions.

Result: Zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images shows recall improvement of 14-22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above baseline.

Conclusion: The combination of adaptive thresholding and cost-sensitive reinforcement learning achieves clinically aligned, open-world polyp detection with substantially fewer false negatives, reducing risk of missed precancerous polyps and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Polyp detectors trained on clean datasets often underperform in real-world endoscopy, where illumination changes, motion blur, and occlusions degrade image quality. Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between controlled laboratory conditions and clinical practice, where adverse imaging conditions are prevalent. In this work, we propose AdaptiveDetector, a novel two-stage detector-verifier framework comprising a YOLOv11 detector with a vision-language model (VLM) verifier. The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement. To enable realistic assessment under challenging conditions, we construct a comprehensive synthetic testbed by systematically degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice, providing a rigorous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation. Extensive zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images demonstrates that our approach improves recall by 14 to 22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above the baseline. This combination of adaptive thresholding and cost-sensitive reinforcement learning achieves clinically aligned, open-world polyp detection with substantially fewer false negatives, thereby reducing the risk of missed precancerous polyps and improving patient outcomes.

*Tasweer Ahmad,Arindam Sikdar,Sandip Pradhan,Ardhendu Behera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-driven relational refinement for few-shot image classification that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies using graph attention, improving discriminative power without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache-based adaptation approaches (like Tip-Adapter) still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative for adapting to specialist domains in low-data regimes.

Method: Proposes a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations. The graph refinement is used only during training to distill relational structure into the cache.

Result: Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. Also validates battlefield relevance with a new Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition.

Conclusion: The patch-driven relational refinement approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing cache-based adaptation methods by learning more discriminative representations from intra-image patch dependencies, achieving better few-shot performance without additional inference cost.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains difficult under limited supervision and visual domain shift. Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the "platinum minutes" and the broader "golden hour" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care.

TL;DR: Using video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D viewpoint and temporal variations from images for data augmentation, improving performance in low-data scenarios like UAV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data augmentation methods rely on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, which don't capture realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations needed for robust computer vision models, especially in data-scarce domains like UAV imagery.

Method: Leverage off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic video clips with diverse camera viewpoints and scene dynamics from static images. Provide guidelines for generative setup selection, annotation transfer to synthetic frames, and handling disocclusion (newly revealed unlabeled regions).

Result: Consistent performance gains in low-data settings, particularly for UAV-captured imagery. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV datasets show the method broadens data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional augmentation methods.

Conclusion: Spatiotemporal augmentation using video foundation models offers an effective approach for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes by generating realistic 3D variations that traditional methods cannot capture.

Abstract: We explore spatiotemporal data augmentation using video foundation models to diversify both camera viewpoints and scene dynamics. Unlike existing approaches based on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, our method leverages off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations from a given image dataset. Incorporating these synthesized video clips as supplemental training data yields consistent performance gains in low-data settings, such as UAV-captured imagery where annotations are scarce. Beyond empirical improvements, we provide practical guidelines for (i) choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal generative setup, (ii) transferring annotations to synthetic frames, and (iii) addressing disocclusion - regions newly revealed and unlabeled in generated views. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets show that, when applied judiciously, spatiotemporal augmentation broadens the data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional and prior generative methods, offering an effective lever for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods using vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) from text-to-video diffusion models produce animations with minimal movement and noticeable jitter, failing to generate substantial and detailed motion for 3D assets.

Method: Introduces Motion Score Distillation (MSD) as an SDS alternative, using a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model with static source distribution, inversion-based noise estimation for appearance preservation, temporal/spatial regularization to reduce geometric distortions, and a motion refinement module for temporal upscaling and detail enhancement.

Result: Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of previous SDS-based methods for text-driven 3D animation, achieving better motion quality and visual fidelity through novel distillation techniques and regularization approaches.

Abstract: We present Animus3D, a text-driven 3D animation framework that generates motion field given a static 3D asset and text prompt. Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate coronary artery segmentation from CT angiography is crucial for clinical analysis but remains challenging due to small vessel sizes, complex branching, blurred boundaries, and myocardial interference.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating myocardial anatomical priors, residual attention-based feature enhancement, 3D wavelet-inverse wavelet transformations for joint spatial-frequency modeling, and multi-scale feature fusion. Uses 3D overlapping patch strategy on ImageCAS dataset with 7:1:2 train/val/test split.

Conclusion: The method enables stable and consistent coronary artery segmentation under complex geometric conditions, providing reliable results for subsequent coronary structure analysis tasks.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation from coronary computed tomography angiography is essential for quantitative coronary analysis and clinical decision support. Nevertheless, reliable segmentation remains challenging because of small vessel calibers, complex branching, blurred boundaries, and myocardial interference. We propose a coronary artery segmentation framework that integrates myocardial anatomical priors, structure aware feature encoding, and three dimensional wavelet inverse wavelet transformations. Myocardial priors and residual attention based feature enhancement are incorporated during encoding to strengthen coronary structure representation. Wavelet inverse wavelet based downsampling and upsampling enable joint spatial frequency modeling and preserve multi scale structural consistency, while a multi scale feature fusion module integrates semantic and geometric information in the decoding stage. The model is trained and evaluated on the public ImageCAS dataset using a 3D overlapping patch based strategy with a 7:1:2 split for training, validation, and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.8082, Sensitivity of 0.7946, Precision of 0.8471, and an HD95 of 9.77 mm, outperforming several mainstream segmentation models. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of individual components. The proposed method enables more stable and consistent coronary artery segmentation under complex geometric conditions, providing reliable segmentation results for subsequent coronary structure analysis tasks.

TL;DR: Supervised contrastive learning for video representation using frame aggregation into single images, avoiding complex video transformers while achieving better accuracy with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient video representation learning that leverages global temporal context without the computational overhead of complex video transformer models, enabling use of pre-trained CNN backbones.

Method: Video-to-image aggregation strategy arranges multiple frames spatially into single images. Uses supervised contrastive learning with positive pairs from same-label videos and negatives from different labels. Creates multiple natural views via different temporal frame samplings instead of data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on Penn Action (76% vs ViVIT's 43%) and HMDB51 (48% vs ViVIT's 37%) with fewer computational resources. Works in both supervised and self-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method effectively learns video representations for classification and captioning tasks while being computationally efficient and avoiding overfitting through natural frame variations.

Abstract: We propose a supervised contrastive learning framework for video representation learning that leverages temporally global context. We introduce a video to image aggregation strategy that spatially arranges multiple frames from each video into a single input image. This design enables the use of pre trained convolutional neural network backbones such as ResNet50 and avoids the computational overhead of complex video transformer models. We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting. Experiments on the Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in classification accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The proposed Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method learns effective video representations in both supervised and self supervised settings and supports video based tasks such as classification and captioning. The method achieves seventy six percent classification accuracy on Penn Action compared to forty three percent achieved by ViVIT and forty eight percent accuracy on HMDB51 compared to thirty seven percent achieved by ViVIT.

TL;DR: Token pruning method for video MLLMs using spatial redundancy metric and masked pruning to reduce computational cost while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online video understanding applications need efficient MLLMs, but current approaches suffer from high GPU memory usage and computational latency due to processing many video frames.

Method: Proposes token pruning with MSSAVT redundancy metric (combines token similarity and spatial position), masked pruning strategy to avoid bidirectional dependency, and integrates temporal redundancy pruning.

Result: Method improves accuracy by up to 4% on multiple video understanding benchmarks with negligible pruning latency (<1ms).

Conclusion: Token pruning with spatial-temporal redundancy consideration effectively reduces computational overhead while enhancing video understanding performance in MLLMs.

Abstract: Online video understanding is essential for applications like public surveillance and AI glasses. However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP is a test-time adaptation framework that uses camera exposure settings (ISO, shutter speed, aperture) as physical prompts to adapt vision-language models from web images to physical environments, achieving significant performance gains over digital-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are trained on web images but need to work in physical environments with sensor-mediated capture. Current methods focus on post-capture digital prompting, but measurement-time physical control could provide better robustness.

Method: MVP acquires multiple physical views per scene by varying camera exposure settings, selects top-k settings using source-affinity scores, evaluates each view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters lowest-entropy augmented views, and aggregates predictions via hard voting (Zero-temperature softmax).

Result: On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP outperforms digital-only TTA by up to 25.6 percentage points on single Auto-Exposure captures, and provides up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines combining conventional sensor control with TTA. Remains effective with reduced parameter sets for lower latency.

Conclusion: Measurement-time control through physical view selection and combination substantially improves VLM robustness beyond post-capture digital prompting, demonstrating the value of treating camera exposure settings as physical prompts for test-time adaptation.

Abstract: To extend the application of vision-language models (VLMs) from web images to sensor-mediated physical environments, we propose Multi-View Physical-prompt for Test-Time Adaptation (MVP), a forward-only framework that moves test-time adaptation (TTA) from tokens to photons by treating the camera exposure triangle--ISO, shutter speed, and aperture--as physical prompts. At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality. These results support the main claim that, beyond post-capture prompting, measurement-time control--selecting and combining real physical views--substantially improves robustness for VLMs.

*Lixin Chen,Chaomeng Chen,Jiale Zhou,Zhijian Wu,Xun Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StegaVAR is a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and performs video action recognition directly in the steganographic domain, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining both concealment and spatiotemporal feature integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy-preserving methods for video action recognition suffer from two main issues: (1) low concealment where visually distorted videos attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption that degrades essential features needed for accurate action recognition.

Method: StegaVAR embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and performs VAR directly in the steganographic domain. It introduces two key components: Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) which uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction during training, and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) which suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. The framework is also effective for multiple steganographic models.

Conclusion: StegaVAR provides a novel solution for privacy-preserving video action recognition by maintaining complete spatiotemporal information of hidden videos while ensuring transmission concealment through natural-looking cover videos, overcoming limitations of existing anonymization methods.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A VLM-based method generates ad layouts by analyzing image content to create placement plans, then rendering them as HTML code, outperforming traditional saliency-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ad layout methods rely on saliency mapping which often fails to account for detailed image composition and semantic content, limiting layout quality.

Method: Two-step pipeline: 1) VLM analyzes image to identify objects and spatial relationships, generating text-based placement plan; 2) Plan rendered into final layout via HTML code generation.

Result: Evaluation shows method produces higher-quality ad layouts compared to existing methods, with both quantitative and qualitative improvements by explicitly considering background image content.

Conclusion: Leveraging VLMs for semantic understanding of background images enables more effective ad layout generation than traditional saliency-based approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for generating layouts for image-based advertisements by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Conventional advertisement layout techniques have predominantly relied on saliency mapping to detect salient regions within a background image, but such approaches often fail to fully account for the image's detailed composition and semantic content. To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based "placement plan" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts.

*Cong Xie,Che Wang,Yan Zhang,Zheng Pan,Han Zou,Zhenpeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for geometry-aware scene-consistent image generation that preserves reference scene environments while generating new entities according to specified spatial relations, balancing scene preservation with prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scene-consistent image generation struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence - they either replicate scenes well but respond poorly to prompts, or prioritize prompts at the expense of scene consistency.

Method: Two key contributions: (1) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline generating diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (2) a novel geometry-guided attention loss leveraging cross-view cues to regularize spatial reasoning.

Result: Experiments on scene-consistent benchmark show better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies.

Conclusion: The method produces geometrically coherent images with diverse compositions that remain faithful to both textual instructions and underlying scene structure, resolving the trade-off between scene preservation and prompt adherence.

Abstract: We study geometry-aware scene-consistent image generation: given a reference scene image and a text condition specifying an entity to be generated in the scene and its spatial relation to the scene, the goal is to synthesize an output image that preserves the same physical environment as the reference scene while correctly generating the entity according to the spatial relation described in the text. Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies. Our method produces geometrically coherent images with diverse compositions that remain faithful to the textual instructions and the underlying scene structure.

*Tingyan Wen,Haoyu Li,Yihuang Chen,Xing Zhou,Lifei Zhu,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Slim is a training-free caching accelerator for diffusion models that uses a dual-threshold controller to push timestep reuse to an early-warning line, then switches to block/token-level refresh, achieving up to 4.97x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational overhead that scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. While feature caching helps, there's a trade-off: aggressive timestep reuse speeds up computation but hurts fidelity, while block/token-level reuse is safer but offers limited savings.

Method: X-Slim introduces a unified framework exploiting redundancy across timesteps, blocks, and tokens. It uses a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into push-then-polish: first pushes timestep-level reuse to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block/token-level refresh, triggering full inference when critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error.

Result: On FLUX.1-dev: 4.97x latency reduction with minimal perceptual loss. On HunyuanVideo: 3.52x latency reduction. On DiT-XL/2: 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

Conclusion: X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier for diffusion models through a novel unified caching framework that intelligently manages redundancy across multiple dimensions, achieving significant acceleration while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level image retrieval needs to handle variations in object size, position, and appearance while providing accurate and spatially grounded matching. Existing methods may lack interpretability or require extensive fine-tuning.

Method: Patchify divides database images into structured patches and compares local patch features with global query descriptors. Uses Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and introduces LocScore metric to evaluate spatial correctness of retrieved regions.

Result: Patchify outperforms global retrieval methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies. The method shows significant performance boost when using informative features during compression.

Conclusion: Patchify provides an effective, scalable, and interpretable patch-wise retrieval framework that enables accurate and spatially grounded matching without fine-tuning, with LocScore serving as a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding retrieval behavior.

Abstract: Instance-level image retrieval aims to find images containing the same object as a given query, despite variations in size, position, or appearance. To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied AI approaches face a dilemma: end-to-end models lack interpretability and explicit 3D reasoning, while modular systems ignore cross-component interdependencies and synergies between planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering.

Method: 1) Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and QA within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline. 2) Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) using masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive partially-annotated hybrid data, allowing different CoT components to mutually reinforce each other.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks: Vision-and-Language Navigation (R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE, NavRAG-CE), Object-goal Navigation (HM3D-OVON), and Task-oriented Sequential Grounding and Navigation (SG3D). Real-world mobile manipulation experiments further validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: D3D-VLP successfully bridges the gap between interpretable 3D reasoning and end-to-end learning, demonstrating superior performance across diverse embodied AI tasks through unified 3D chain-of-thought reasoning and synergistic learning from fragmented supervision.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a critical dilemma that end-to-end models lack interpretability and explicit 3D reasoning, while modular systems ignore cross-component interdependencies and synergies. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model (D3D-VLP). Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data. This allows different CoT components to mutually reinforce and implicitly supervise each other. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset with 10M hybrid samples from 5K real scans and 20K synthetic scenes that are compatible with online learning methods such as RL and DAgger. Our D3D-VLP achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including Vision-and-Language Navigation (R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE, NavRAG-CE), Object-goal Navigation (HM3D-OVON), and Task-oriented Sequential Grounding and Navigation (SG3D).

TL;DR: DMLR is a dynamic multimodal latent reasoning framework that uses confidence-guided optimization and dynamic visual injection to improve reasoning and perception in multimodal models while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning methods rely on explicit step-by-step reasoning, have unstable perception-reasoning interaction, and incur high computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition where thinking involves dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception, the authors aim to create a more efficient and effective multimodal reasoning framework.

Method: DMLR uses confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. It introduces a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy that retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token, updates the best visual patches, and injects them into latent think tokens to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving.

Result: Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures show that DMLR significantly improves both reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DMLR provides an effective framework for dynamic multimodal reasoning that better mimics human cognitive processes, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced cross-modal understanding and reasoning by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the semantic space. Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs have impressive vision-language capabilities but lack fine-grained visual perception and precise spatial reasoning. Current models struggle with detailed visual analysis and accurate spatial understanding.

Method: 1) DiG proxy task: MLLMs identify and localize all differences between similar image pairs without prior knowledge of difference count. 2) Automated 3D rendering pipeline generates high-quality paired images with controllable discrepancies. 3) Curriculum learning progressively increases complexity from single to multiple differences for stable optimization.

Result: DiG significantly improves model performance across various visual perception benchmarks. Learned fine-grained perception skills transfer effectively to standard downstream tasks including RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and general multimodal perception benchmarks.

Conclusion: Differential grounding is a scalable and robust approach for advancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs, addressing their limitations in detailed visual perception and spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved impressive performance on a variety of vision-language tasks, yet their fine-grained visual perception and precise spatial reasoning remain limited. In this work, we introduce DiG (Differential Grounding), a novel proxy task framework where MLLMs learn fine-grained perception by identifying and localizing all differences between similar image pairs without prior knowledge of their number. To support scalable training, we develop an automated 3D rendering-based data generation pipeline that produces high-quality paired images with fully controllable discrepancies. To address the sparsity of difference signals, we further employ curriculum learning that progressively increases complexity from single to multiple differences, enabling stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiG significantly improves model performance across a variety of visual perception benchmarks and that the learned fine-grained perception skills transfer effectively to standard downstream tasks, including RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and general multimodal perception benchmarks. Our results highlight differential grounding as a scalable and robust approach for advancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARe is a simple yet effective method for cross-modal fundus image registration that handles large field-of-view disparity by first cropping the target image to roughly align FoVs, then using improved spatial transformation with RANSAC and polynomial fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous cross-modal fundus image registration methods assume small FoV disparity, but real-world scenarios often involve large FoV differences between OCTA (small FoV) and wide-field color fundus photographs, making existing methods ineffective.

Method: CARe uses a two-step approach: 1) Crop operation exploits retinal physiological structure to crop target wfCFP to roughly match source OCTA FoV, enabling reuse of existing registration methods; 2) Alignment module uses double-fitting with RANSAC and polynomial-based coordinate fitting for improved spatial transformation.

Result: Extensive experiments on a new test set of 60 OCTA-wfCFP pairs demonstrate CARe's viability for cross-modal fundus image registration with large FoV disparity.

Conclusion: CARe provides an effective solution for challenging cross-modal fundus image registration with large field-of-view disparity, overcoming limitations of previous methods through simple crop-and-align approach.

Abstract: Previous work on cross-modal fundus image registration (CMFIR) assumes small cross-modal Field-of-View (FoV) disparity. By contrast, this paper is targeted at a more challenging scenario with large FoV disparity, to which directly applying current methods fails. We propose Crop and Alignment for cross-modal fundus image Registration(CARe), a very simple yet effective method. Specifically, given an OCTA with smaller FoV as a source image and a wide-field color fundus photograph (wfCFP) as a target image, our Crop operation exploits the physiological structure of the retina to crop from the target image a sub-image with its FoV roughly aligned with that of the source. This operation allows us to re-purpose the previous small-FoV-disparity oriented methods for subsequent image registration. Moreover, we improve spatial transformation by a double-fitting based Alignment module that utilizes the classical RANSAC algorithm and polynomial-based coordinate fitting in a sequential manner. Extensive experiments on a newly developed test set of 60 OCTA-wfCFP pairs verify the viability of CARe for CMFIR.

Abstract: Current document reasoning paradigms are constrained by a fundamental trade-off between scalability (processing long-context documents) and fidelity (capturing fine-grained, multimodal details). To bridge this gap, we propose CogDoc, a unified coarse-to-fine thinking framework that mimics human cognitive processes: a low-resolution "Fast Reading" phase for scalable information localization,followed by a high-resolution "Focused Thinking" phase for deep reasoning. We conduct a rigorous investigation into post-training strategies for the unified thinking framework, demonstrating that a Direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach outperforms RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) initialization. Specifically, we find that direct RL avoids the "policy conflict" observed in SFT. Empirically, our 7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance within its parameter class, notably surpassing significantly larger proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) on challenging, visually rich document benchmarks.

Method: Multi-stage training to learn unified motion-speech-prompt embedding space, augmented dataset with object annotations, Generalized Motion Adaptation Module for independent training, adaptive fusion strategy to balance heterogeneous conditioning signals during diffusion sampling.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in both co-speech gesture generation and object-interaction synthesis, producing highly realistic, object-aware full-body motions with enhanced realism, flexibility, and control.

Conclusion: InteracTalker successfully unifies previously separate tasks of speech-driven gestures and object interactions, enabling more comprehensive and realistic human motion generation for interactive applications.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions that naturally respond to both spoken language and physical objects is crucial for interactive digital experiences. Current methods, however, address speech-driven gestures or object interactions independently, limiting real-world applicability due to a lack of integrated, comprehensive datasets. To overcome this, we introduce InteracTalker, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates prompt-based object-aware interactions with co-speech gesture generation. We achieve this by employing a multi-stage training process to learn a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space. To support this, we curate a rich human-object interaction dataset, formed by augmenting an existing text-to-motion dataset with detailed object interaction annotations. Our framework utilizes a Generalized Motion Adaptation Module that enables independent training, adapting to the corresponding motion condition, which is then dynamically combined during inference. To address the imbalance between heterogeneous conditioning signals, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy, which dynamically reweights the conditioning signals during diffusion sampling. InteracTalker successfully unifies these previously separate tasks, outperforming prior methods in both co-speech gesture generation and object-interaction synthesis, outperforming gesture-focused diffusion methods, yielding highly realistic, object-aware full-body motions with enhanced realism, flexibility, and control.

*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Teng Long,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework for Open-World DeepFake Attribution, addressing confidence skew and unknown type count assumptions through adaptive confidence balancing and dynamic prototype pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of synthetic facial imagery creates urgent need for robust Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA). Existing methods suffer from confidence skew leading to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, and unrealistic assumption that number of unknown forgery types is known beforehand.

Method: Proposes Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework with two main components: 1) Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) that dynamically scales sample losses based on normalized confidence, shifting focus from high- to low-confidence samples; 2) Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR) that separately calibrates confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples. Also introduces Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy to automatically estimate number of novel forgery types in coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard OW-DFA benchmark and newly extended benchmark with advanced manipulations show CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution.

Conclusion: CAL framework effectively addresses critical limitations in OW-DFA by balancing model confidence across known and novel forgery types and removing unrealistic prior assumptions about unknown type counts, making it more scalable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of synthetic facial imagery has intensified the need for robust Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to attribute both known and unknown forgeries using labeled data for known types and unlabeled data containing a mixture of known and novel types. However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSR method improves online test-time adaptation for transformers by progressively recalibrating self-attention using conditioned scale-shift factors to address domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models suffer performance degradation when applied to new domains due to significant changes in Query, Key, and Value features in self-attention modules during domain shift.

Method: Progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) using local linear transforms parameterized by scale and shift factors. Domain Separation Network extracts domain shift features, and Factor Generator Network predicts recalibration parameters, both adapted online during inference.

Result: Significantly improves online test-time domain adaptation performance by up to 3.9% classification accuracy on ImageNet-C dataset.

Conclusion: PCSR effectively addresses transformer performance degradation in new domains through progressive self-attention recalibration, enabling better online adaptation with lightweight networks.

Abstract: Online test-time adaptation aims to dynamically adjust a network model in real-time based on sequential input samples during the inference stage. In this work, we find that, when applying a transformer network model to a new target domain, the Query, Key, and Value features of its self-attention module often change significantly from those in the source domain, leading to substantial performance degradation of the transformer model. To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset.

TL;DR: Scone is a unified understanding-generation method that integrates composition and distinction for multi-subject image generation, addressing the limitation of existing models in distinguishing between multiple candidate subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subject-driven image generation has advanced from single- to multi-subject composition but neglects distinction - the ability to identify and generate the correct subject when inputs contain multiple candidates. This limitation restricts effectiveness in complex, realistic visual settings.

Method: Scone integrates composition and distinction through a unified understanding-generation approach. The understanding expert acts as a semantic bridge, conveying semantic information to guide the generation expert to preserve subject identity while minimizing interference. A two-stage training scheme first learns composition, then enhances distinction through semantic alignment and attention-based masking.

Result: Scone outperforms existing open-source models in both composition and distinction tasks on two benchmarks. The authors also introduce SconeEval, a benchmark for evaluating both composition and distinction across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Scone provides an effective unified approach for multi-subject image generation that addresses both composition and distinction challenges, enabling better performance in complex, realistic visual settings. The model, benchmark, and training data are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: β-CLIP is a multi-granular vision-language framework that achieves hierarchical alignment between text granularities (captions, sentences, phrases) and corresponding visual regions through contextualized contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP performs well on global image-text retrieval but struggles with fine-grained tasks even when fine-tuned on detailed captions. There's a need for better hierarchical alignment between different textual granularities and their corresponding visual regions.

Method: Proposes β-CLIP with multi-granular text-conditioned contrastive learning. Uses cross-attention to dynamically pool image patches for each text granularity level. Introduces β-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss (β-CAL) that parameterizes trade-off between strict query-specific matching and relaxed intra-image contextualization, supporting both soft and hard formulations.

Result: Achieves 91.8% T2I and 92.3% I2T at R@1 on Urban1K, and 30.9% on FG-OVD (Hard), setting state-of-the-art among methods trained without hard negatives. Significantly improves dense alignment performance.

Conclusion: β-CLIP establishes a robust, adaptive baseline for dense vision-language correspondence by enabling hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities and their corresponding visual regions through contextualized contrastive learning.

Abstract: CLIP achieves strong zero-shot image-text retrieval by aligning global vision and text representations, yet it falls behind on fine-grained tasks even when fine-tuned on long, detailed captions. In this work, we propose $β$-CLIP, a multi-granular text-conditioned contrastive learning framework designed to achieve hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities-from full captions to sentences and phrases-and their corresponding visual regions. For each level of granularity, $β$-CLIP utilizes cross-attention to dynamically pool image patches, producing contextualized visual embeddings. To address the semantic overlap inherent in this hierarchy, we introduce the $β$-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss ($β$-CAL). This objective parameterizes the trade-off between strict query-specific matching and relaxed intra-image contextualization, supporting both soft Cross-Entropy and hard Binary Cross-Entropy formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $β$-CLIP significantly improves dense alignment: achieving 91.8% T2I 92.3% I2T at R@1 on Urban1K and 30.9% on FG-OVD (Hard), setting state-of-the-art among methods trained without hard negatives. $β$-CLIP establishes a robust, adaptive baseline for dense vision-language correspondence.

*Xue Li,Xiaonan Song,Henry Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATP is an adaptive token pruning method for VLMs that dynamically selects informative tokens using hybrid importance scores, reducing FLOPs by ~40% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models is hindered by high computational demands due to inefficient uniform token processing across all tokens.

Method: ATP uses a lightweight gating module that assigns hybrid importance scores combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep only top-K tokens for the LLM, adapting to each input without modifying backbone architectures.

Result: ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40%, achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (<1%) on VQAv2, GQA, and COCO benchmarks, and shows improved robustness under corruptions by suppressing spurious correlations.

Conclusion: Resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives; ATP enables efficient multimodal edge computing while preserving visual grounding and interpretability.

Abstract: Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly. We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.

*Boyuan Li,Sipeng Zheng,Bin Cao,Ruihua Song,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a part-aware masked autoregression model that leverages credible body parts from noisy video data to generate complete human motions, addressing the data quality vs. scale dilemma in motion extraction from web videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web videos offer scalable motion data but often contain incomplete human poses due to off-screen captures or occlusions. Discarding incomplete data limits scale and diversity, while using it compromises quality and model performance.

Method: 1) Decompose human body into 5 parts and detect credible (clearly visible) parts in video frames; 2) Encode credible parts into latent tokens using part-aware variational autoencoder; 3) Use robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts while ignoring noisy parts.

Result: Method outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in motion quality, semantic consistency, and diversity. Also introduces K700-M benchmark with ~200k real-world motion sequences for evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the data quality-scale tradeoff by leveraging credible part-level data from noisy videos, enabling scalable motion generation from web videos while maintaining high quality.

Abstract: Extracting human motion from large-scale web videos offers a scalable solution to the data scarcity issue in character animation. However, some human parts in many video frames cannot be seen due to off-screen captures or occlusions. It brings a dilemma: discarding the data missing any part limits scale and diversity, while retaining it compromises data quality and model performance.
  To address this problem, we propose leveraging credible part-level data extracted from videos to enhance motion generation via a robust part-aware masked autoregression model. First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as "credible". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.
  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: multi-image approaches require expensive equipment and complex procedures, while single-image methods struggle with occlusion and viewpoint limitations for accurately estimating internal structures like spine center line.

Method: Integrates depth images from four directions to restore 3D human model, uses hierarchical matching (global and fine registration) for noise/occlusion restoration, applies Adaptive Vertex Reduction to maintain mesh resolution/shape reliability, and uses Level of Detail ensemble for spinal angle estimation accuracy/stability.

Result: Achieves high-precision 3D spine registration estimation without relying on training data or complex neural network models, with verification confirming improved matching quality.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully compensates for multi-image method shortcomings and solves single-image method limitations, providing accurate 3D body posture analysis and spine center line estimation.

Abstract: The spinal angle is an important indicator of body balance. It is important to restore the 3D shape of the human body and estimate the spine center line. Existing mul-ti-image-based body restoration methods require expensive equipment and complex pro-cedures, and single image-based body restoration methods have limitations in that it is difficult to accurately estimate the internal structure such as the spine center line due to occlusion and viewpoint limitation. This study proposes a method to compensate for the shortcomings of the multi-image-based method and to solve the limitations of the sin-gle-image method. We propose a 3D body posture analysis system that integrates depth images from four directions to restore a 3D human model and automatically estimate the spine center line. Through hierarchical matching of global and fine registration, restora-tion to noise and occlusion is performed. Also, the Adaptive Vertex Reduction is applied to maintain the resolution and shape reliability of the mesh, and the accuracy and stabil-ity of spinal angle estimation are simultaneously secured by using the Level of Detail en-semble. The proposed method achieves high-precision 3D spine registration estimation without relying on training data or complex neural network models, and the verification confirms the improvement of matching quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on single diffusion models to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and produces physically inconsistent outputs. Physics-aware driving world models are essential for planning, data synthesis, and evaluation.

Method: 1) Generate 4D occupancy as physics-informed foundation with rich 3D structure and dynamics. 2) Use VAE to compress occupancy into latent tri-plane representation (58% size reduction). 3) Introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to model control influence on occupancy evolution. 4) Joint end-to-end training of VAE and prediction module. 5) Use Normalized Multi-View Attention in video generation with 4D occupancy guidance.

Conclusion: GenieDrive overcomes limitations of existing methods by using 4D occupancy as physics foundation, efficient compression, and novel attention mechanisms, enabling superior physics-aware driving video generation with improved accuracy, speed, and quality.

Abstract: Physics-aware driving world model is essential for drive planning, out-of-distribution data synthesis, and closed-loop evaluation. However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation. Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD. Experiments demonstrate that GenieDrive enables highly controllable, multi-view consistent, and physics-aware driving video generation.

Method: CoRe3D uses a unified 3D reasoning framework that operates over both semantic and spatial abstractions. It employs a spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, enabling compositional and procedural reasoning over geometry. The approach tightly couples semantic chain-of-thought inference with structured spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning mechanisms are critical for advancing 3D multimodal models, and CoRe3D's approach of combining semantic and spatial reasoning provides an effective framework for achieving reliable, interpretable, and language-aligned 3D content generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models suggest that explicit reasoning mechanisms play a critical role in improving model reliability, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment. While such reasoning-centric approaches have been proven effective in language and vision tasks, their extension to 3D remains underdeveloped. CoRe3D introduces a unified 3D understanding and generation reasoning framework that jointly operates over semantic and spatial abstractions, enabling high-level intent inferred from language to directly guide low-level 3D content formation. Central to this design is a spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, allowing the model to reason over geometry in a compositional and procedural manner. By tightly coupling semantic chain-of-thought inference with structured spatial reasoning, CoRe3D produces 3D outputs that exhibit strong local consistency and faithful alignment with linguistic descriptions.

TL;DR: Fast-2DGS is a lightweight framework that uses a conditional network (Deep Gaussian Prior) and attribute regression to predict 2D Gaussian configurations in a single forward pass, reducing computational cost while maintaining high-quality image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D Gaussian Splatting methods require slow post-optimization (10+ seconds) or use complex learnable networks that increase computational overhead. There's a need for efficient, lightweight solutions that can achieve high-quality Gaussian image representations suitable for industry deployment.

Method: Proposes Fast-2DGS with two key components: 1) Deep Gaussian Prior - a conditional network that captures spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives based on image complexity, and 2) Attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Uses disentangled architecture for single-forward-pass reconstruction with minimal fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass with minimal fine-tuning. Significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining visual quality. Enables faster convergence compared to existing methods that require >10 seconds for optimization.

Conclusion: Fast-2DGS bridges the gap between quality and efficiency in 2D Gaussian Splatting, making the technology more suitable for industry-ready deployment by reducing computational complexity without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly capable of producing high-fidelity visual content, the demand for efficient, interpretable, and editable image representations has grown substantially. Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment.

TL;DR: L-STEC method improves neural video compression by extending reference window with LSTM and incorporating warped spatial context, achieving 37% bitrate savings over DCVC-TCM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural video compression methods rely only on previous frame features, missing long-term dependencies and fine texture details, while feature-level propagation accumulates errors over frames causing prediction inaccuracies.

Method: Proposes Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC): 1) Extends reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, 2) Incorporates warped spatial context from pixel domain, 3) Fuses spatio-temporal information through multi-receptive field network.

Result: Achieves 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information through long-term dependencies and spatial context fusion, addressing limitations of existing condition-based frameworks.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression has emerged in recent years, with condition-based frameworks outperforming traditional codecs. However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

There's a need for unified frameworks that can handle spatial understanding, 3D perception, prediction, and planning together.

Method: Proposes DrivePI, a spatial-aware 4D MLLM that integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions in a unified architecture. Uses end-to-end optimization to jointly perform spatial understanding, 3D occupancy perception, occupancy flow prediction, and action planning. Includes a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding.

Result: With only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 backbone, DrivePI matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA, reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION, surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy, reduces mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD for planning.

Conclusion: DrivePI demonstrates that a unified spatial-aware 4D MLLM can effectively handle multiple autonomous driving tasks simultaneously with strong performance, showing the potential of MLLMs for fine-grained 3D perception and prediction in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Although multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application in generating fine-grained 3D perception and prediction outputs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

### [107] [Learning Common and Salient Generative Factors Between Two Image Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12800)
*Yunlong He,Gwilherm Lesné,Ziqian Liu,Michaël Soumm,Pietro Gori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for Contrastive Analysis (CA) that separates common generative factors (shared across two datasets) from salient ones (specific to one dataset) using only dataset signals, adaptable to both GAN and Diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing work focuses on conditional manipulation or disentangled representation learning using attribute supervision. This paper addresses the less studied problem of Contrastive Analysis - separating common vs. salient generative factors between two datasets using only dataset-level signals rather than attribute supervision.

Method: Proposes a novel framework with new learning strategies and losses specifically designed for Contrastive Analysis. The approach is adaptable to both GAN and Diffusion models, ensuring relevant separation between common and salient factors while maintaining high-quality generation.

Result: Evaluated on diverse datasets including human faces, animal images, and medical scans. The framework demonstrates superior separation ability and image quality synthesis compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Contrastive Analysis framework successfully separates common and salient generative factors across datasets using only dataset signals, outperforming existing methods in both separation quality and generation quality across multiple domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis have enabled high-quality image generation and manipulation. Most works focus on: 1) conditional manipulation, where an image is modified conditioned on a given attribute, or 2) disentangled representation learning, where each latent direction should represent a distinct semantic attribute. In this paper, we focus on a different and less studied research problem, called Contrastive Analysis (CA). Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors. By defining new and well-adapted learning strategies and losses, we ensure a relevant separation between common and salient factors, preserving a high-quality generation. We evaluate our approach on diverse datasets, covering human faces, animal images and medical scans. Our framework demonstrates superior separation ability and image quality synthesis compared to prior methods.

Motivation: Current large multimodal models face challenges in scaling to 3D understanding: point cloud data is sparse/irregular, existing architectures use fragmented modality-specific encoders, and training pipelines suffer from instability and poor scalability.

Method: A unified transformer architecture that processes 3D point cloud patches and language tokens as a single sequence, with structured patchification/tokenization to preserve spatial context, and a three-stage training curriculum from object-level to scene-level reasoning.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across comprehensive 3D understanding and reasoning tasks, including object recognition, captioning, and spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, while demonstrating robust scaling properties.

Conclusion: Lemon provides a unified foundation for advancing 3D spatial intelligence in real-world applications by enabling early spatial-linguistic fusion, eliminating redundant encoders, and improving parameter efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Scaling large multimodal models (LMMs) to 3D understanding poses unique challenges: point cloud data is sparse and irregular, existing models rely on fragmented architectures with modality-specific encoders, and training pipelines often suffer from instability and poor scalability. We introduce Lemon, a unified transformer architecture that addresses these challenges by jointly processing 3D point cloud patches and language tokens as a single sequence. Unlike prior work that relies on modality-specific encoders and cross-modal alignment modules, this design enables early spatial-linguistic fusion, eliminates redundant encoders, improves parameter efficiency, and supports more effective model scaling. To handle the complexity of 3D data, we develop a structured patchification and tokenization scheme that preserves spatial context, and a three-stage training curriculum that progressively builds capabilities from object-level recognition to scene-level spatial reasoning. Lemon establishes new state-of-the-art performance across comprehensive 3D understanding and reasoning tasks, from object recognition and captioning to spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, while demonstrating robust scaling properties as model size and training data increase. Our work provides a unified foundation for advancing 3D spatial intelligence in real-world applications.

*N. K. B. M. P. K. B. Narasinghe,Uthayasanker Thayasivam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive study on adapting CoCa foundation models for few-shot image classification, evaluating strategies from training-free prototyping to LoRA fine-tuning, revealing augmentation divergence and benefits of hybrid objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CoCa models show strong zero-shot capabilities, their adaptation to few-shot learning with extreme data scarcity remains under-explored, especially compared to CLIP-style models. There's a gap in understanding how CoCa's unique generative-contrastive architecture responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of adaptation strategies for CoCa visual backbone: from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Experiments include analyzing augmentation effects, comparing hybrid objectives (Supervised Contrastive vs Cross-Entropy), and characterizing sensitivity to data scarcity.

Result: Identified "augmentation divergence": strong augmentation harms linear probing but stabilizes LoRA fine-tuning. SupCon loss consistently outperforms standard Cross-Entropy across shot counts. Provided empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies for efficient adaptation.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for adapting generative-contrastive foundation models like CoCa to few-shot scenarios, revealing nuanced trade-offs in augmentation strategies and demonstrating the value of hybrid objectives for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal foundation models, particularly Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), have achieved state-of-the-art results by unifying contrastive alignment with generative captioning. While zero-shot transfer capabilities are well-documented, the adaptation of these generative-contrastive hybrids to downstream tasks with extreme data scarcity (few-shot learning) remains under-explored. Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an "augmentation divergence": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint audio-visual editing is important for precise content creation but faces challenges due to limited paired data and modality heterogeneity. Existing approaches lack synchronized editing across audio and video.

Method: Proposes SAVE: an end-to-end flow-matching model with Schrodinger Bridge that learns direct transport from source to target audiovisual mixtures. Uses SAVEBench dataset with text and mask conditions for object-grounded learning.

Result: SAVE successfully removes target objects from both audio and visual content while preserving remaining content. Achieves stronger temporal synchronization and audiovisual semantic correspondence compared to separate audio/video editor combinations.

Conclusion: The proposed SAVE model enables effective joint audio-visual editing with improved synchronization, addressing data and modeling challenges through a novel dataset and Schrodinger Bridge-based architecture.

Abstract: Joint editing of audio and visual content is crucial for precise and controllable content creation. This new task poses challenges due to the limitations of paired audio-visual data before and after targeted edits, and the heterogeneity across modalities. To address the data and modeling challenges in joint audio-visual editing, we introduce SAVEBench, a paired audiovisual dataset with text and mask conditions to enable object-grounded source-to-target learning. With SAVEBench, we train the Schrodinger Audio-Visual Editor (SAVE), an end-to-end flow-matching model that edits audio and video in parallel while keeping them aligned throughout processing. SAVE incorporates a Schrodinger Bridge that learns a direct transport from source to target audiovisual mixtures. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed SAVE model is able to remove the target objects in audio and visual content while preserving the remaining content, with stronger temporal synchronization and audiovisual semantic correspondence compared with pairwise combinations of an audio editor and a video editor.

### [111] [Cross-Level Sensor Fusion with Object Lists via Transformer for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12884)
*Xiangzhong Liu,Jiajie Zhang,Hao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end Transformer-based cross-level fusion method that integrates object lists with raw camera images for 3D object detection, using object lists as denoising queries and incorporating deformable Gaussian masks for attention guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In automotive sensor fusion, smart sensors and V2X modules provide processed object lists rather than raw data. Traditional approaches fuse at object level after separate processing, but there's a need for direct integration of abstract object list information with raw sensor data for better 3D detection.

Method: 1) Uses Transformer architecture with object lists as denoising queries alongside learnable queries; 2) Introduces deformable Gaussian mask derived from object list positional/size priors to guide attention to target areas; 3) Generates pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives/negatives for training.

Result: Shows substantial performance improvements over vision-based baseline on nuScenes dataset. Demonstrates generalization capability across diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.

Conclusion: This is the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, successfully integrating highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection, with demonstrated effectiveness and robustness to noise.

Abstract: In automotive sensor fusion systems, smart sensors and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) modules are commonly utilized. Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.

Motivation: Traditional deep learning struggles with many sign classes and impractical exhaustive labeling; need scalable zero-shot recognition for intelligent transportation systems.

Method: Adapts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): 1) Vision Language Model generates textual description from input image, 2) retrieves relevant candidates from vector database of reference designs, 3) Large Language Model reasons over retrieved candidates for fine-grained recognition.

Result: Achieved 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data across 303 regulatory signs from Ohio MUTCD.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable, accurate road sign recognition systems without task-specific training.

Abstract: Automated road sign recognition is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems, but traditional deep learning methods struggle with the sheer number of sign classes and the impracticality of creating exhaustive labeled datasets. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training.

Abstract: 3D medical image classification is essential for modern clinical workflows. Medical foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for scaling to new tasks, yet current research suffers from three critical pitfalls: data-regime bias, suboptimal adaptation, and insufficient task coverage. In this paper, we address these pitfalls and introduce AnyMC3D, a scalable 3D classifier adapted from 2D FMs. Our method scales efficiently to new tasks by adding only lightweight plugins (about 1M parameters per task) on top of a single frozen backbone. This versatile framework also supports multi-view inputs, auxiliary pixel-level supervision, and interpretable heatmap generation. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 12 tasks covering diverse pathologies, anatomies, and modalities, and systematically analyze state-of-the-art 3D classification techniques. Our analysis reveals key insights: (1) effective adaptation is essential to unlock FM potential, (2) general-purpose FMs can match medical-specific FMs if properly adapted, and (3) 2D-based methods surpass 3D architectures for 3D classification. For the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse applications using a single scalable framework (including 1st place in the VLM3D challenge), eliminating the need for separate task-specific models.

TL;DR: Qonvolutions enhance neural networks' ability to learn high-frequency signals by combining convolution with query mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various vision and graphics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with learning high-frequency signals due to spectral bias and optimization difficulties. Existing methods like Fourier encodings have limitations when dealing with high-frequency information, creating a need for better approaches.

Method: Queried-Convolutions (Qonvolutions) modify convolution by incorporating neighborhood properties and query mechanisms. They convolve low-frequency signals with queries (like coordinates) to better capture intricate high-frequency patterns.

Result: Qonvolutions improve performance across multiple high-frequency learning tasks: 1D regression, 2D super-resolution, 2D image regression, and novel view synthesis. When combined with Gaussian splatting for NVS, they achieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world complex scenes, outperforming radiance field models in image quality.

Conclusion: Qonvolutions provide a simple yet effective solution to the high-frequency learning problem in neural networks, demonstrating superior performance across diverse computer vision and graphics applications.

Abstract: Accurately learning high-frequency signals is a challenge in computer vision and graphics, as neural networks often struggle with these signals due to spectral bias or optimization difficulties. While current techniques like Fourier encodings have made great strides in improving performance, there remains scope for improvement when presented with high-frequency information. This paper introduces Queried-Convolutions (Qonvolutions), a simple yet powerful modification using the neighborhood properties of convolution. Qonvolution convolves a low-frequency signal with queries (such as coordinates) to enhance the learning of intricate high-frequency signals. We empirically demonstrate that Qonvolutions enhance performance across a variety of high-frequency learning tasks crucial to both the computer vision and graphics communities, including 1D regression, 2D super-resolution, 2D image regression, and novel view synthesis (NVS). In particular, by combining Gaussian splatting with Qonvolutions for NVS, we showcase state-of-the-art performance on real-world complex scenes, even outperforming powerful radiance field models on image quality.

*Zhimao Peng,Enguang Wang,Xialei Liu,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PSA framework for SCOOD with dual-threshold ternary sample assignment and concept contrastive learning, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SCOOD methods use clustering-based IDF strategies that introduce noisy samples during training by selecting clean ID samples from unlabeled data and treating remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data.

Method: Proposes predictive sample assignment (PSA) framework with: 1) dual-threshold ternary sample assignment based on predictive energy scores to improve purity of selected ID/OOD sets by adding discard set for unconfident samples, 2) concept contrastive representation learning to expand distance between ID and OOD in representation space, 3) retraining strategy to fully fit selected auxiliary samples.

Result: Experiments on two standard SCOOD benchmarks show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margin.

Conclusion: The PSA framework effectively addresses noise issues in SCOOD training through improved sample assignment and representation learning, achieving superior OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SCOOD) is a recently proposed realistic OOD detection setting: given labeled in-distribution (ID) data and mixed in-distribution and out-of-distribution unlabeled data as the training data, SCOOD aims to enable the trained model to accurately identify OOD samples in the testing data. Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA). PSA includes a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy based on the predictive energy score that can significantly improve the purity of the selected ID and OOD sample sets by assigning unconfident unlabeled data to an additional discard sample set, and a concept contrastive representation learning loss to further expand the distance between ID and OOD samples in the representation space to assist ID/OOD discrimination. In addition, we also introduce a retraining strategy to help the model fully fit the selected auxiliary ID/OOD samples. Experiments on two standard SCOOD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

*Zhimao Peng,Enguang Wang,Fei Yang,Xialei Liu,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GCD method with Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) to reduce noisy pseudo-labels from large pre-trained models, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCD methods using DINO-like pseudo-labeling suffer from noisy pseudo-labels because large pre-trained models encode spurious correlations and have preferences for specific visual patterns, leading to poor clustering performance.

Method: Proposes two modules: 1) Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) - enhances parameter robustness by minimizing worst-case loss sharpness to suppress trivial features and reduce noise overfitting; 2) Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) - selects representative unknown class samples using KNN density and class probability, assigning hard pseudo-labels to alleviate confidence differences and learn accurate feature distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively mitigates pseudo-label noise and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed LSP and DAS modules successfully address the pseudo-label noise problem in GCD, improving clustering accuracy by enhancing model robustness and better handling unknown class distributions.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is an important and challenging task in open-world learning. Specifically, given some labeled data of known classes, GCD aims to cluster unlabeled data that contain both known and unknown classes. Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks.

TL;DR: MADTempo is a video retrieval framework that combines temporal search for multi-event queries with web-scale visual grounding using Google Image Search to handle unseen/rare concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video retrieval systems struggle with modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts, limiting their ability to understand complex temporal structures in videos.

Method: MADTempo unifies two components: 1) Temporal search mechanism that captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, and 2) Google Image Search-based fallback module that expands query representations with external web imagery to bridge gaps in pretrained visual embeddings.

Result: The framework advances temporal reasoning and generalization capabilities of video retrieval systems, improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries and enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries.

Conclusion: MADTempo paves the way for more semantically aware and adaptive video retrieval across large-scale video corpora by addressing both temporal dependencies and visual concept generalization challenges.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video content across online platforms has accelerated the need for retrieval systems capable of understanding not only isolated visual moments but also the temporal structure of complex events. Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. Together, these components advance the temporal reasoning and generalization capabilities of modern video retrieval systems, paving the way for more semantically aware and adaptive retrieval across large-scale video corpora.

Motivation: Current end-to-end video compression frameworks lack content-specific adaptation, leading to suboptimal compression performance. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a framework that adapts encoding strategies to diverse content characteristics.

Method: Three key components: 1) Two-stage flow-guided deformable warping with coarse-to-fine offset prediction and mask modulation for precise feature alignment; 2) Multi-reference quality aware strategy with distortion weight adjustment based on reference quality, applied to hierarchical training; 3) Training-free module that downsamples frames by motion magnitude and resolution for smooth motion estimation.

Result: CAMA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art neural video compression models, with 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings over baseline DCVC-TCM, and also outperforms reproduced DCVC-DC and traditional codec HM-16.25 on standard test datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed content adaptive motion alignment framework effectively addresses the content adaptation limitation in neural video compression, demonstrating substantial performance gains through adaptive encoding strategies tailored to content characteristics.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end video compression have shown promising results owing to their unified end-to-end learning optimization. However, such generalized frameworks often lack content-specific adaptation, leading to suboptimal compression performance. To address this, this paper proposes a content adaptive based motion alignment framework that improves performance by adapting encoding strategies to diverse content characteristics. Specifically, we first introduce a two-stage flow-guided deformable warping mechanism that refines motion compensation with coarse-to-fine offset prediction and mask modulation, enabling precise feature alignment. Second, we propose a multi-reference quality aware strategy that adjusts distortion weights based on reference quality, and applies it to hierarchical training to reduce error propagation. Third, we integrate a training-free module that downsamples frames by motion magnitude and resolution to obtain smooth motion estimation. Experimental results on standard test datasets demonstrate that our framework CAMA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art Neural Video Compression models, achieving a 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings over our baseline model DCVC-TCM, while also outperforming reproduced DCVC-DC and traditional codec HM-16.25.

TL;DR: UAGLNet: Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network for building extraction from remote sensing images, using hybrid CNN-transformer encoder and uncertainty modeling to improve segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing building extraction methods suffer from inaccurate results due to inherent gaps in feature pyramids and insufficient integration of global-local features, especially with complex building structures in remote sensing images.

Method: Proposes UAGLNet with: 1) Cooperative encoder using hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages, 2) Intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) to bridge local-global feature gaps, 3) Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module for complementary feature fusion, 4) Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) for pixel-wise uncertainty estimation to enhance segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for building extraction from remote sensing images.

Conclusion: UAGLNet effectively addresses building extraction challenges by integrating global-local semantics with uncertainty modeling, achieving more accurate segmentation results for complex building structures in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Building extraction from remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the complex structure variations of the buildings. Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet

TL;DR: SCAdapter is a novel diffusion-based style transfer method that uses CLIP image space to separate and integrate content/style features, achieving photo-realistic transfers with 2x faster inference than other diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for style transfer struggle with photo-realistic results, often producing painting-like outputs or missing detailed stylistic elements. Existing methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features.

Method: SCAdapter leverages CLIP image space to systematically extract pure content from content images and style elements from style references. It uses three key components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective to maintain process coherence.

Result: SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, it achieves at least 2x faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: SCAdapter provides a more effective and efficient solution for practical style transfer applications, achieving photo-realistic results while being faster than existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

TL;DR: VLCache is a cache reuse framework for multimodal LLMs that reuses KV and encoder caches from previous inputs to avoid recomputation, achieving near-perfect accuracy with only 2-5% token computation and 1.2x-16x speedups.


<details>

Result: Achieves accuracy on par with full recomputation while requiring only 2-5% of tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. Successfully integrated into SGLang for practical deployment.

Conclusion: VLCache effectively eliminates costly recomputation for recurring multimodal inputs through formal error minimization and layer-aware strategies, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. The proposed VLCache pipeline has been integrated into SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "Benefit then Conflict" dilemma where AIGI detector performance degrades with increased source diversity, and proposes GAPL framework with canonical forgery prototypes and LoRA adaptation to achieve state-of-the-art detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current universal AIGI detectors face a paradox: while aggregating data from multiple generators initially improves generalization, performance eventually degrades as source diversity expands due to data heterogeneity and model bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL) with two key components: 1) Learning compact canonical forgery prototypes to create unified low-variance feature space, and 2) Two-stage training with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance discriminative power while preserving pretrained knowledge.

Result: GAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior detection accuracy across various GAN and diffusion-based generators, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The Benefit then Conflict dilemma can be effectively addressed through structured prototype learning and adaptive model enhancement, enabling more robust universal AIGI detection across diverse generators.

Abstract: The pursuit of a universal AI-generated image (AIGI) detector often relies on aggregating data from numerous generators to improve generalization. However, this paper identifies a paradoxical phenomenon we term the Benefit then Conflict dilemma, where detector performance stagnates and eventually degrades as source diversity expands. Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing superior detection accuracy across a wide variety of GAN and diffusion-based generators.

### [124] [Calibrating Uncertainty for Zero-Shot Adversarial CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12997)
*Wenjing lu,Zerui Tao,Dongping Zhang,Yuning Qiu,Yang Yang,Qibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial fine-tuning for CLIP that addresses both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, using Dirichlet distribution reparameterization to align clean and adversarial predictions holistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP has strong zero-shot classification but is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial fine-tuning focuses only on logit matching, overlooking uncertainty calibration. Adversarial perturbations often suppress uncertainty, causing miscalibration and over-confidence, creating a critical reliability gap beyond just robustness.

Method: Reparameterize CLIP output as concentration parameter of Dirichlet distribution to capture both semantic structure and predictive confidence magnitude. Propose adversarial fine-tuning objective that aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring to restore calibrated uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks show the approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty, achieves competitive adversarial robustness, and maintains clean accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the reliability gap in CLIP by addressing both adversarial robustness and uncertainty calibration, providing a more comprehensive solution for reliable zero-shot classification under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiFT-6DoF introduces a light field-based object tracking method that doesn't require pre-trained models, using view-dependent Gaussian splats from vision foundation model features to handle complex reflective objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object tracking methods rely on pre-captured object views and explicit reference models, which limit them to known objects and struggle with visually complex appearances like reflections. There's a need for more universal tracking that can handle unseen objects with complex visual behavior.

Method: Extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models, then convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. This unified object representation supports differentiable rendering and pose optimization for tracking without requiring pre-trained models.

Result: The method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers on challenging reflective objects, as demonstrated on a new light field object tracking dataset containing reflective objects with precise ground truth poses.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust object tracking for complex visual behavior like reflections without dependency on pre-trained models, advancing toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

Abstract: Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

*Xi Luo,Shixin Xu,Ying Xie,JianZhong Hu,Yuwei He,Yuhui Deng,Huaxiong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TWLR is a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy assessment that combines vision-language models for grading/classification with iterative severity regression for lesion localization without pixel-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis requires costly pixel-level annotations, and deep learning models lack interpretability, limiting clinical adoption. The paper aims to address both annotation efficiency and interpretability challenges for diabetic retinopathy assessment.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Vision-language model integrates ophthalmological knowledge for DR grading and lesion classification; 2) Iterative severity regression with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation generates lesion saliency maps and progressive inpainting to downgrade disease severity toward healthy appearances.

Result: TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation on FGADR, DDR, and private datasets, providing accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and interpretable disease-to-healthy transformation visualizations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis, addressing both the annotation cost problem and interpretability limitations of current deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Accurate medical image analysis can greatly assist clinical diagnosis, but its effectiveness relies on high-quality expert annotations Obtaining pixel-level labels for medical images, particularly fundus images, remains costly and time-consuming. Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis.

TL;DR: JoDiffusion is a novel diffusion framework that simultaneously generates paired synthetic images and semantically consistent annotation masks from text prompts for training semantic segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation is costly and time-intensive. Existing synthetic dataset generation methods suffer from image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problems, requiring either pseudo annotation prediction after image generation or manual annotation masks as input.

Method: 1) Incorporates an independent annotation VAE to map annotation masks into the same latent space as images; 2) Tailors diffusion model to capture joint distribution of images and annotation masks conditioned on text prompts; 3) Uses mask optimization strategy to mitigate annotation noise during generation.

Result: Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods when using datasets generated by JoDiffusion.

Conclusion: JoDiffusion enables scalable generation of semantically consistent image-annotation pairs from text prompts, solving both semantic inconsistency and scalability problems in synthetic dataset generation for semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Given the inherently costly and time-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation, the generation of synthetic datasets comprising sufficiently diverse synthetic images paired with ground-truth pixel-level annotations has garnered increasing attention recently for training high-performance semantic segmentation models. However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent unified models for joint understanding and generation have significantly advanced visual generation capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial generalization is crucial for practical deployment of deep learning-based RF sensing systems, as models need to maintain accuracy across different environments with varying layouts.

Method: Systematically investigated multiple approaches: amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting, threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Evaluated using FMCW MIMO radar for indoor people counting across two different environments.

Result: Sigmoid-based amplitude weighting achieved 50.1% RMSE and 55.2% MAE reductions compared to baselines. Data augmentation provided modest improvements (up to 8.8% MAE). Transfer learning was essential for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% RMSE and 91.3% MAE reductions with 540 target-domain samples.

Conclusion: The optimal approach for robust radar sensing under spatial variations combines deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning, establishing a practical direction for developing spatially-generalizable RF sensing systems.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of spatial generalization techniques, which are essential for the practical deployment of deep learning-based radio-frequency (RF) sensing. Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with maintaining temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps in instructional video generation, which has important applications in content creation, education, and human-AI interaction.

Method: A pipeline with three key innovations: (1) predictive causal adaptation for next-frame prediction and future keyframe anticipation, (2) future-guided self-forcing with dual-region KV caching to address exposure bias, and (3) multi-prompt conditioning for fine-grained procedural control over multi-step instructions.

Result: The method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions, demonstrating improved consistency and controllability.

Conclusion: SneakPeek effectively mitigates temporal drift, preserves motion consistency, and enables interactive video generation where future prompt updates can dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation.

Abstract: Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

TL;DR: Motus is a unified latent action world model that integrates understanding, video generation, and action experts using a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, enabling flexible multimodal capabilities and superior performance in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied agent methods are fragmented with isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control, preventing unified multimodal generative capabilities and hindering learning from large-scale heterogeneous data.

Method: Proposes Motus with Mixture-of-Transformer architecture integrating three experts (understanding, video generation, action), uses UniDiffuser-style scheduler for flexible modeling modes, learns latent actions via optical flow, and employs three-phase training pipeline with six-layer data pyramid.

Result: Achieves +15% improvement over X-VLA and +45% improvement over Pi0.5 in simulation, and +11~48% improvement in real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks, showing the effectiveness of the integrated approach for embodied agents.

Abstract: While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining.

*Tomoya Tanaka,Tomonori Ikeda,Ryo Yonemoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive comparison of rule-based, traditional ML, and deep learning methods for radio wave sensing with FMCW MIMO radar, showing trade-offs between accuracy, granularity, and domain shift robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare different approaches (rule-based, traditional ML, deep learning) for radio wave sensing with FMCW MIMO radar, particularly examining their performance in familiar vs. new environments and their robustness to domain shift.

Method: Evaluated five approaches across two indoor environments with distinct layouts: 1) rule-based connected component method, 2) k-nearest neighbors, 3) random forest, 4) support vector machine, and 5) CNN-LSTM deep learning model.

Result: In training environment, CNN-LSTM achieved highest accuracy; traditional ML showed moderate performance. In new layout, all learning-based methods degraded significantly while rule-based method remained stable. For binary detection (presence vs. absence), all models performed well across layouts.

Conclusion: High-capacity models provide fine-grained outputs with high accuracy in same environment but are vulnerable to domain shift. Rule-based methods lack fine granularity but offer robustness against domain shift. Clear trade-off exists between spatial generalization performance and output granularity regardless of model type.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of rule-based methods, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in radio wave sensing with frequency modulated continuous wave multiple input multiple output radar. We systematically evaluated five approaches in two indoor environments with distinct layouts: a rule-based connected component method; three traditional machine learning models, namely k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine; and a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network and long short term memory. In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity.

*Hao Chen,Yiwei Wang,Songze Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-Erasing: A bidirectional image-guided framework that simultaneously suppresses harmful concepts and enhances safe alternatives in diffusion models, achieving better balance between erasure efficacy and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods use unidirectional strategies (either suppressing target concepts or reinforcing safe alternatives), making it difficult to achieve balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality.

Method: Proposes Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) with two decoupled image branches: negative branch suppresses harmful semantics, positive branch provides visual guidance for safe alternatives. Uses joint text-image representation and mask-based filtering to prevent interference from irrelevant content.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity across extensive experiment evaluations.

Conclusion: Bi-Erasing framework achieves better balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability by simultaneously optimizing concept suppression and safety enhancement through complementary bidirectional approach.

Abstract: Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTR-Turbo: An efficient upgrade to Guided Thought Reinforcement that eliminates need for expensive teacher models by merging RL checkpoints to create a free teacher, improving performance while reducing compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn RL for vision-language agents suffers from sparse rewards and long-horizon credit assignment. Existing methods like GTR use expensive teacher models (GPT/Gemini) for step-level feedback, which limits practicality and reproducibility due to high costs.

Method: GTR-Turbo merges weights of checkpoints produced during ongoing RL training, then uses this merged model as a "free" teacher to guide subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This eliminates dependence on privileged VLMs.

Result: Improves baseline model accuracy by 10-30% across diverse visual agentic tasks, reduces wall-clock training time by 50% and compute cost by 60% relative to original GTR. Also mitigates "entropy collapse" and keeps training stable.

Conclusion: GTR-Turbo provides a highly efficient alternative to teacher-dependent RL methods, achieving comparable performance without expensive external models, making multi-modal agent training more practical and reproducible.

Abstract: Multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-modal agents built upon vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by sparse rewards and long-horizon credit assignment. Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a "free" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the "entropy collapse" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable. Across diverse visual agentic tasks, GTR-Turbo improves the accuracy of the baseline model by 10-30% while reducing wall-clock training time by 50% and compute cost by 60% relative to GTR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like DINOv2 achieve excellent VPR performance but are too computationally expensive for resource-constrained devices, creating a need for efficient deployment solutions.

Method: Asymmetric framework with high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction and lightweight query network for online processing. Uses geographical memory bank to structure gallery features using geolocation metadata (eliminating k-NN computations) and implicit embedding augmentation to enhance query network's ability to model feature variations.

Result: Method significantly reduces computational costs while outperforming existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing new state-of-the-art for VPR in resource-limited environments.

Conclusion: The proposed asymmetric VPR framework with geographical memory bank and implicit embedding augmentation enables efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices while maintaining high performance, making VPR practical for real-world applications with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has advanced significantly with high-capacity foundation models like DINOv2, achieving remarkable performance. Nonetheless, their substantial computational cost makes deployment on resource-constrained devices impractical. In this paper, we introduce an efficient asymmetric VPR framework that incorporates a high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction with a lightweight query network for online processing. A key challenge in this setting is ensuring compatibility between these heterogeneous networks, which conventional approaches address through computationally expensive k-NN-based compatible training. To overcome this, we propose a geographical memory bank that structures gallery features using geolocation metadata inherent in VPR databases, eliminating the need for exhaustive k-NN computations. Additionally, we introduce an implicit embedding augmentation technique that enhances the query network to model feature variations despite its limited capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces computational costs but also outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing a new aspect for VPR in resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: A multimodal RAG-enhanced continual learning framework for medical VLMs that dynamically balances intra-modality feature preservation and cross-modality domain adaptation using knowledge distillation and a comprehensive medical retrieval database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal biomedical VLMs face a core dilemma in continual learning: preserving fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging significant domain gaps across different modalities. Current approaches struggle with this balance in medical applications.

Method: 1) Build 18M multimodal medical retrieval database from PubMed; 2) Integrate RAG into CL with multi-modal, multi-layer retrieval system for real-time guidance; 3) Dynamic knowledge distillation framework that modulates parameter importance, knowledge granularity, and data distribution based on required detail level.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics on the proposed Medical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark, demonstrating superior adaptation to domain shifts, retention of intra-domain features, and real-time learning of complex medical tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG-enhanced dynamic knowledge distillation framework effectively resolves the core dilemma in medical VLMs continual learning, providing a comprehensive solution that balances feature preservation with domain adaptation through intelligent knowledge retrieval and distillation.

Abstract: Multimodal biomedical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit immense potential in the field of Continual Learning (CL). However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: Heart disease prediction using intelligent systems, with Case-Based Reasoning achieving 97.95% accuracy and identifying gender-based risk differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heart disease prediction methods relying on doctor's experience lack precision, creating a need for more accurate intelligent systems to improve medical diagnosis.

Method: Compared three intelligent systems (Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Case-Based Reasoning), selected CBR, performed data pre-processing and splitting, then applied CBR to predict heart disease outcomes.

Result: CBR achieved 97.95% accuracy in heart disease prediction, with males having 57.76% probability and females 42.24% probability of heart disease.

Conclusion: Case-Based Reasoning is effective for heart disease prediction, with gender differences in risk and lifestyle factors like smoking/alcohol consumption being significant contributors, especially for males.

Abstract: This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males.

### [140] [UniVCD: A New Method for Unsupervised Change Detection in the Open-Vocabulary Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13089)
*Ziqiang Zhu,Bowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVCD is an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method that uses frozen SAM2 and CLIP models with a lightweight feature alignment module to detect category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods rely heavily on supervised learning, making them dataset-dependent, expensive to annotate, and poor at generalizing to diverse scenes and categories. Vision foundation models like SAM2 and CLIP offer new opportunities to overcome these limitations.

Method: UniVCD combines frozen SAM2 (for spatial detail) and CLIP (for semantic priors) with a lightweight feature alignment module. It includes a streamlined post-processing pipeline to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change detection without training on labeled data.

Result: Experiments on public BCD and SCD benchmarks show UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance, matching or surpassing existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics like F1 and IoU.

Conclusion: Unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary change detection, offering strong performance without the need for labeled training data.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) identifies scene changes from multi-temporal observations and is widely used in urban development and environmental monitoring. Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD. Code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/Die-Xie/UniVCD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADHint improves RL fine-tuning by incorporating difficulty-aware hint scheduling and advantage estimation to balance exploration and imitation, achieving better reasoning generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hint-based RL methods ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. There's a need for better trade-off between exploration and imitation.

Method: 1) Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior: evaluates sample difficulty under policy model and schedules appropriate hint ratios. 2) Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation: modulates token-level gradients within hints. 3) Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior: leverages relative difficulty of rollouts with/without hints for advantage estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains show ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8 metrics.

Conclusion: ADHint successfully incorporates difficulty as a key factor in hint-based RL, achieving better trade-off between exploration and imitation, leading to improved reasoning generalization across various settings.

Abstract: To combine the advantages of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), recent methods have integrated ''hints'' into post-training, which are prefix segments of complete reasoning trajectories, aiming for powerful knowledge expansion and reasoning generalization. However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: UnCoL: A dual-teacher framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that balances generalization from foundation models with task-specific specialization using uncertainty-guided pseudo-label learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models struggle with specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations due to mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. Need to harmonize generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Method: Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL) with dual-teacher framework: 1) Distills visual and semantic representations from frozen foundation model for general knowledge, 2) Maintains progressively adapting teacher for fine-grained task-specific representations, 3) Uses predictive uncertainty to adaptively regulate pseudo-label learning, suppressing unreliable supervision and stabilizing learning in ambiguous regions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks. Achieves near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.

Conclusion: UnCoL effectively balances generalization from foundation models with task-specific specialization through uncertainty-guided collaborative learning, enabling robust semi-supervised medical image segmentation with limited annotations.

Abstract: Vision foundation models have demonstrated strong generalization in medical image segmentation by leveraging large-scale, heterogeneous pretraining. However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forest pest monitoring methods are inefficient for large-scale, fine-grained detection, creating a need for automated systems to accurately identify infected trees and analyze infestation patterns for effective forest management.

Method: FID-Net builds on YOLOv8n with three key modules: Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) for disease-sensitive cues, Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (AMFM) for RGB and FEM feature fusion, and Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) for discriminative information. The framework also includes spatial analysis using Kernel Density Estimation for hotspots, neighborhood evaluation for infection risk, and DBSCAN clustering for priority protection zones.

Conclusion: FID-Net enables accurate tree health discrimination and, combined with spatial metrics, provides reliable data for intelligent pest monitoring, early warning, and precise forest management, supporting targeted protection strategies.

Abstract: Forest pests threaten ecosystem stability, requiring efficient monitoring. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods in large-scale, fine-grained detection, this study focuses on accurately identifying infected trees and analyzing infestation patterns. We propose FID-Net, a deep learning model that detects pest-affected trees from UAV visible-light imagery and enables infestation analysis via three spatial metrics. Based on YOLOv8n, FID-Net introduces a lightweight Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) to extract disease-sensitive cues, an Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (AMFM) to align and fuse dual-branch features (RGB and FEM-enhanced), and an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism to enhance discriminative information efficiently. From detection results, we construct a pest situation analysis framework using: (1) Kernel Density Estimation to locate infection hotspots; (2) neighborhood evaluation to assess healthy trees' infection risk; (3) DBSCAN clustering to identify high-density healthy clusters as priority protection zones. Experiments on UAV imagery from 32 forest plots in eastern Tianshan, China, show that FID-Net achieves 86.10% precision, 75.44% recall, 82.29% mAP@0.5, and 64.30% mAP@0.5:0.95, outperforming mainstream YOLO models. Analysis confirms infected trees exhibit clear clustering, supporting targeted forest protection.

Conclusion: DiffFusion effectively addresses weather-induced challenges in multi-modal 3D object detection through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive fusion, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization with open-source implementation.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dense 3D point tracking have limitations: they rely on pairwise processing, require known camera poses, or assume temporal ordering. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction from unposed images suggest opportunities for unified dynamic scene understanding.

Method: DePT3R uses a powerful backbone to extract deep spatio-temporal features and regresses pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads, enabling simultaneous point tracking and 3D reconstruction in a single forward pass without camera poses.

Result: DePT3R demonstrates strong performance on challenging dynamic scene benchmarks and shows significant improvements in memory efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DePT3R provides an efficient, flexible framework for unified dynamic scene understanding that eliminates dependencies on camera poses and temporal ordering, making it well-suited for rapidly changing dynamic environments.

Abstract: Current methods for dense 3D point tracking in dynamic scenes typically rely on pairwise processing, require known camera poses, or assume a temporal ordering to input frames, constraining their flexibility and applicability. Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LeafTrackNet is a new framework for accurate leaf tracking in complex crops like canola, using YOLOv10 detection and MobileNetV3 embeddings with memory association, achieving 9% HOTA improvement on the new CanolaTrack dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current leaf tracking methods are limited to small-scale species or constrained imaging conditions, while generic multi-object tracking methods aren't designed for dynamic biological scenes. There's also a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions for complex crops like canola.

Method: LeafTrackNet combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy.

Result: LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on the CanolaTrack benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The work provides a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and contributes CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agricultural crops, which will support future plant phenotyping research.

Abstract: High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping.

TL;DR: Weight Space Correlation Analysis is a method to detect if medical AI models use encoded metadata as shortcuts by analyzing weight vector alignment between clinical and metadata classification heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging models often encode confounding metadata (like scanner type) in embeddings, raising concerns about whether models actually use this information as shortcuts for predictions rather than genuine clinical signals.

Method: Weight Space Correlation Analysis measures alignment between classification heads of primary clinical tasks and auxiliary metadata tasks to quantify feature utilization patterns.

Result: Method successfully detected artificially induced shortcuts and showed that an SA-SonoNet model for preterm birth prediction used clinically relevant features while avoiding acquisition-related metadata shortcuts.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness by demonstrating that clinical models can selectively utilize genuine clinical signals while avoiding metadata shortcuts when not artificially biased.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.

### [148] [StarryGazer: Leveraging Monocular Depth Estimation Models for Domain-Agnostic Single Depth Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13147)
*Sangmin Hong,Suyoung Lee,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StarryGazer is a domain-agnostic unsupervised depth completion framework that combines sparse depth maps with monocular depth estimation (MDE) models without needing ground-truth depth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised depth completion methods require auxiliary data that doesn't match real scenarios, while MDE models produce relative depth maps but can't properly combine with sparse depth data. Simple affine transformations of MDE results yield high errors due to inaccurate depth difference estimation between objects.

Method: 1) Use pre-trained MDE model to generate relative depth images, 2) Segment and randomly rescale these images to create synthetic training pairs (dense pseudo-ground truth + corresponding sparse depths), 3) Train a refinement network using these synthetic pairs along with relative depth maps and RGB images to improve accuracy and robustness.

Result: StarryGazer shows superior performance over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results across various datasets, demonstrating effective exploitation of MDE model capabilities while correcting errors using sparse depth information.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between MDE models and depth completion by creating synthetic training data from MDE outputs, enabling domain-agnostic depth completion without ground-truth depth while properly leveraging sparse depth information to fix MDE inaccuracies.

Abstract: The problem of depth completion involves predicting a dense depth image from a single sparse depth map and an RGB image. Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information.

TL;DR: Intrinsic Image Fusion reconstructs high-quality physically based materials from multi-view images using diffusion priors and robust optimization with inverse path tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material reconstruction from multi-view images is highly underconstrained and typically relies on expensive, noisy path tracing. Existing methods struggle with consistency and quality in material disentanglement.

Method: 1) Use diffusion-based material estimator for single-view priors; 2) Fit explicit low-dimensional parametric function to predictions; 3) Robust optimization with soft per-view prediction selection and confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set; 4) Inverse path tracing to optimize low-dimensional parameters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in material disentanglement on both synthetic and real scenes, producing sharp and clean reconstructions suitable for high-quality relighting.

Conclusion: Intrinsic Image Fusion effectively combines single-view priors with multi-view consistency through robust optimization, enabling high-quality material reconstruction suitable for relighting applications.

Abstract: We introduce Intrinsic Image Fusion, a method that reconstructs high-quality physically based materials from multi-view images. Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in material disentanglement on both synthetic and real scenes, producing sharp and clean reconstructions suitable for high-quality relighting.

Abstract: The development of clinical-grade artificial intelligence in pathology is limited by the scarcity of diverse, high-quality annotated datasets. Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.

*Hongxuan Sun,Tao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFSS is a novel data-free knowledge distillation framework specifically designed for semantic segmentation that respects structural continuity and uses BN statistics for better data sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free knowledge distillation methods are designed for classification tasks and treat pixels independently, ignoring the structural continuity essential for semantic segmentation, leading to significant performance degradation when applied to segmentation tasks.

Method: DFSS uses Batch Normalization statistics from the teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS) for selecting data that better reflects original training distribution. It also proposes Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD) that dynamically prioritizes reliable samples aligned with original distribution early, then gradually incorporates more challenging cases.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data.

Conclusion: DFSS provides an effective data-free distillation framework for semantic segmentation that respects structural continuity and better approximates original training distribution, outperforming previous methods while reducing dependency on auxiliary data.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation requires a holistic understanding of the physical world, as it assigns semantic labels to spatially continuous and structurally coherent objects rather than to isolated pixels. However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMDrive is a multimodal vision-language model for autonomous driving that extends 2D image understanding to 3D scene understanding by fusing occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for autonomous driving are limited by 2D image understanding paradigms, which restrict their ability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, leading to suboptimal performance in complex driving environments.

Method: MMDrive introduces a multimodal framework with three complementary modalities: occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. It features two novel components: 1) Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator that dynamically weights modality contributions based on semantic cues, and 2) Cross-Modal Abstractor that uses learnable abstract tokens to generate compact cross-modal summaries highlighting key regions and semantics.

Result: MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models, with BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM benchmark, and 62.7% accuracy on NuScenes-QA benchmark.

Conclusion: MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.

*Gong Chen,Chaokun Zhang,Pengcheng Lv,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRA is a hybrid collaborative perception architecture that combines intermediate and late fusion to achieve both high performance and robustness against communication errors, with significantly reduced communication volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA collaborative perception methods using intermediate fusion are vulnerable to performance degradation under adverse communication conditions due to data transmission misalignment, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: CoRA uses a hybrid approach with two branches: 1) feature-level fusion branch for efficient critical feature selection and fusion, and 2) object-level correction branch that leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements from pose errors.

Result: Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves baseline performance by ~19% in AP@0.7 with >5x less communication volume, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: CoRA provides a promising solution for robust collaborative perception by decoupling performance from robustness through complementary intermediate and late fusion approaches.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention as a crucial technology to overcome the perceptual limitations of single-agent systems. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face relighting progress is constrained by limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. Existing methods lack physically interpretable illumination modeling.

Method: POLAR dataset with 200+ subjects under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and expressions. POLARNet uses flow-based generative model to predict per-light OLAT responses from single portrait, modeling illumination as continuous physically interpretable transformation.

Result: POLAR provides large-scale physically calibrated dataset. POLARNet captures fine-grained direction-aware illumination effects while preserving identity, enabling scalable and controllable relighting.

Conclusion: POLAR and POLARNet form unified illumination learning framework linking real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing self-sustaining cycle for scalable portrait illumination.

Abstract: Face relighting aims to synthesize realistic portraits under novel illumination while preserving identity and geometry. However, progress remains constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. To address this, we introduce POLAR, a large-scale and physically calibrated One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) dataset containing over 200 subjects captured under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and diverse expressions. Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining "chicken-and-egg" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models in providing expert-level assistance during procedural tasks, addressing the lack of high-quality dialogue data between experts and trainees in egocentric settings.

Method: Used a "Wizard of OZ" data collection paradigm where experts act as wearable intelligent assistants, viewing trainees' activities from their egocentric perspective and providing guidance through natural language dialogues. Collected 50 hours of unscripted videos, transcribed two-way dialogues, and created 15k+ Visual Question Answer sets.

Result: Created a challenging benchmark dataset that reveals limitations of current multimodal LLMs in providing expert-level assistance, with the dataset publicly available for research.

Conclusion: Ego-EXTRA provides a valuable resource for benchmarking egocentric video-language assistants and demonstrates that current models struggle with expert-level assistance tasks, highlighting areas for future improvement in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: We present Ego-EXTRA, a video-language Egocentric Dataset for EXpert-TRAinee assistance. Ego-EXTRA features 50 hours of unscripted egocentric videos of subjects performing procedural activities (the trainees) while guided by real-world experts who provide guidance and answer specific questions using natural language. Following a ``Wizard of OZ'' data collection paradigm, the expert enacts a wearable intelligent assistant, looking at the activities performed by the trainee exclusively from their egocentric point of view, answering questions when asked by the trainee, or proactively interacting with suggestions during the procedures. This unique data collection protocol enables Ego-EXTRA to capture a high-quality dialogue in which expert-level feedback is provided to the trainee. Two-way dialogues between experts and trainees are recorded, transcribed, and used to create a novel benchmark comprising more than 15k high-quality Visual Question Answer sets, which we use to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models. The results show that Ego-EXTRA is challenging and highlight the limitations of current models when used to provide expert-level assistance to the user.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARCaster is a unified identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that handles both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis using identity embeddings or reference images, overcoming limitations of existing 2D and 3D approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D speech-to-video models rely heavily on reference guidance, limiting motion diversity, while 3D-aware animation often suffers from imperfect reconstructions and identity drift due to inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators.

Method: Uses compositional approach: ID-aware motion modeling → audio-visual synchronization via lip reading → novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. Employs decoupled learning for view consistency and temporal coherence, plus self-forcing training for longer temporal contexts.

Result: STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks for both speech-driven animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis.

Conclusion: STARCaster presents a unified framework that overcomes limitations of existing 2D and 3D approaches through softer identity constraints, implicit 3D awareness in 2D video domain, and innovative training schemes for better motion diversity and identity preservation.

Abstract: This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.

TL;DR: VG-AVS enables VLMs to select optimal next viewpoints for better visual understanding, moving beyond static image reasoning to active vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited to static image reasoning, while embodied agents need active vision to gather information through movement. There's a gap between snapshot vision and ambulatory vision needed for real-world applications.

Method: 1) Introduce VG-AVS task for next viewpoint selection using only current visual info; 2) Create synthetic dataset with query-target view pairs and QA prompts; 3) Fine-tune pretrained VLMs with SFT followed by RL-based policy optimization.

Result: Achieves strong QA performance through viewpoint selection, generalizes to unseen synthetic/real scenes, and improves downstream QA accuracy when integrated into existing scene-exploration EQA systems.

Conclusion: VG-AVS bridges snapshot and ambulatory vision, enabling VLMs to actively gather visual information for better scene understanding and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual question answering (VQA) but remain limited to snapshot vision, reasoning from static images. In contrast, embodied agents require ambulatory vision, actively moving to obtain more informative views. We introduce Visually Grounded Active View Selection (VG-AVS), a task that selects the most informative next viewpoint using only the visual information in the current image, without relying on scene memory or external knowledge. To support this task, we construct a synthetic dataset with automatically generated paired query-target views and question-answer prompts. We also propose a framework that fine-tunes pretrained VLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL-based policy optimization. Our approach achieves strong question answering performance based on viewpoint selection and generalizes robustly to unseen synthetic and real scenes. Furthermore, incorporating our learned VG-AVS framework into existing scene-exploration-based EQA systems improves downstream question-answering accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods struggle with fine-grained instructions specifying precise attributes like colors, positions, and quantities. Current approaches using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only optimize at individual sampling steps, providing sparse feedback that limits trajectory-level control.

Method: CogniEdit combines multi-modal reasoning with dense reward optimization: (1) Multi-modal Large Language Models decompose complex instructions into actionable directives, (2) Dynamic Token Focus Relocation adaptively emphasizes fine-grained attributes, and (3) Dense GRPO-based optimization propagates gradients across consecutive denoising steps for trajectory-level supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CogniEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance in balancing fine-grained instruction following with visual quality and editability preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling trajectory-level gradient flow through the sampling process, achieving superior fine-grained instruction following while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing with diffusion models has achieved impressive results, yet existing methods struggle with fine-grained instructions specifying precise attributes such as colors, positions, and quantities.

TL;DR: Video Reality Test is an ASMR-based benchmark for evaluating perceptual realism of AI-generated videos with audio, showing current models can fool most VLMs but not human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to test whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs, as existing benchmarks focus on video-only classification without audio.

Method: Created Video Reality Test benchmark using curated ASMR videos with tight audio-visual coupling, featuring an adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators trying to fool reviewers (VLMs).

Result: Best creator (Veo3.1-Fast) fools most VLMs - strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56% accuracy vs random 50%, far below human experts (81.25%). Audio improves discrimination but superficial cues like watermarks still mislead models.

Conclusion: Current video generation models approach but don't match human-level realism; VLMs have limitations in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency; audio-visual benchmarks are crucial for evaluating true realism.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\% accuracy (random 50\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency.

*Bo Liu,Qiao Qin,Qinghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalCLIP is a framework that disentangles causal from non-causal features in generated image detection using causal inference principles, achieving better generalization across unseen generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generated image detectors produce entangled representations mixing task-relevant forensic cues with spurious patterns, limiting generalization across diverse and evolving generation techniques.

Method: Models generation process with structural causal model, uses Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and HSIC constraints to enforce statistical independence, isolating stable causal features robust to distribution shifts.

Result: Achieves 6.83% improvement in accuracy and 4.06% improvement in average precision over state-of-the-art methods when tested on unseen generative models from different series.

Conclusion: CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability by explicitly disentangling causal from non-causal features and retaining only the most transferable forensic cues.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has increased the demand for generated image detectors capable of generalizing across diverse and evolving generation techniques. However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods.

*Shu Yu,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LINA introduces a novel framework that learns prompt-specific interventions to improve diffusion models' physical alignment and out-of-distribution instruction following by addressing causal reasoning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with physical alignment and out-of-distribution instruction following due to failure to learn causal directions and disentangle causal factors for novel recombination.

Method: Introduces Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset for diagnostic interventions, then proposes LINA framework that learns prompt-specific interventions using targeted guidance in prompt/visual latent spaces and reallocated causality-aware denoising schedule.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset, enforcing both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video diffusion models.

Conclusion: LINA successfully addresses diffusion models' causal reasoning limitations through adaptive interventions, improving their ability to handle physical alignment and out-of-distribution instructions.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

Abstract: While existing generation and unified models excel at general image generation, they struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning, planning, and precise data-to-visual mapping abilities beyond general scenarios. To push beyond the existing limitations, we introduce a new and challenging task: creative table visualization, requiring the model to generate an infographic that faithfully and aesthetically visualizes the data from a given table. To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results.

TL;DR: KlingAvatar 2.0 is a spatio-temporal cascade framework for efficient long-duration high-resolution avatar video generation that addresses temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following through blueprint keyframes, first-last frame refinement, and a Co-Reasoning Director with LLM experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior avatar video generation models suffer from limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, experiencing temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases.

Method: Proposes a spatio-temporal cascade framework that: 1) generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes for global semantics and motion, 2) refines them into high-resolution sub-clips using first-last frame strategy, 3) introduces a Co-Reasoning Director with three modality-specific LLM experts for cross-modal instruction fusion, and 4) includes a Negative Director for prompt refinement. Also extends to ID-specific multi-character control.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model effectively addresses challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.

Conclusion: KlingAvatar 2.0 successfully overcomes limitations of prior work in long-duration high-resolution avatar video generation through its spatio-temporal cascade framework and intelligent cross-modal reasoning components.

Abstract: Avatar video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.

### [164] [Face Identity Unlearning for Retrieval via Embedding Dispersion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13317)
*Mikhail Zakharov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy concerns in face recognition systems by proposing a dispersion-based unlearning method to make selected identities unretrievable while preserving overall system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems pose serious privacy risks due to potential unauthorized identity tracking. While machine unlearning has been explored for privacy protection, its application to modern embedding-based face retrieval systems remains largely unexplored.

Method: The paper evaluates existing approximate class unlearning methods (Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning) and proposes a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach that disperses target identity embeddings on the hypersphere to prevent compact cluster formation.

Result: Extensive experiments on VGGFace2 and CelebA benchmarks demonstrate superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dispersion-based unlearning method effectively addresses privacy concerns in face retrieval systems by making selected identities unretrievable while maintaining the discriminative structure of the embedding space for remaining identities.

Abstract: Face recognition systems rely on learning highly discriminative and compact identity clusters to enable accurate retrieval. However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility.

*Carla Monteiro,Valentina Corbetta,Regina Beets-Tan,Luís F. Teixeira,Wilson Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel polyp segmentation framework using DINO self-attention key features with simple convolutional decoder achieves SOTA performance with superior generalization in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL methods for polyp segmentation struggle with generalization in data-constrained settings and rely on complex, task-specific architectures. There's a need for more robust and generalizable approaches.

Method: Leverages DINO self-attention "key" features (instead of deepest layer tokens) with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks. Validated using multi-center datasets under Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG) protocols.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with comprehensive statistical analysis, significantly enhancing generalization in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. Surpasses established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net without polyp-specific architecture.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that leveraging DINO self-attention key features with simple decoder provides robust polyp segmentation with superior generalization, offering a systematic benchmark of DINO's evolution impact on medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for improving the clinical identification of colorectal cancer (CRC). While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention "key" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance.

*Anran Qi,Changjian Li,Adrien Bousseau,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free image-to-video generation method that separates motion specification from appearance synthesis using a user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph for controllable articulation and user-specified content in disoccluded regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-video pipelines struggle with predictable, articulated motions and enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed (disoccluded) areas of the final frame.

Method: Introduces a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically drives part motion, while using a frozen diffusion prior as a motion-guided shader. Users annotate/repose PDG, compute dense motion flow, edit appearance in disoccluded areas, and perform latent-space composite using visibility information.

Result: Demonstrates clear advantages over state-of-the-art alternatives for turning images into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables, enabling controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The method successfully mixes generative control (loose pose and structure) with predictable controls (appearance specification in disoccluded regions), unlocking a new image-to-video workflow that separates motion specification from appearance synthesis.

Abstract: We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow. Code will be released on acceptance. Project page: https://anranqi.github.io/beyondvisible.github.io/

TL;DR: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be repurposed as an effective refinement mechanism to fix topological errors in segmentation masks, improving connectivity and structure without task-specific architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General segmentation models often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs with topological errors, and fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or specialized architectures for each task.

Method: Propose refinement NCA (rNCA) that uses local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. The automaton learns structural properties of target shapes by training on imperfect masks and ground truths, relying solely on local information to progressively reconnect broken regions and prune loose fragments.

Result: For retinal vessels: 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice, reduces β₀ errors by 60% and β₁ by 20%. For myocardium: repairs 61.5% of broken cases in zero-shot setting, lowers ASSD by 19% and HD by 16%. Shows NCA as broadly applicable refiners.

Conclusion: Neural Cellular Automata can serve as effective and broadly applicable refinement mechanisms for fixing topological errors in segmentation masks, improving structural correctness without requiring task-specific architectures or hand-crafted rules.

Abstract: Accurately predicting topologically correct masks remains a difficult task for general segmentation models, which often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs. Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to create photorealistic environment/object representations, game engine physics for natural arrangements, two-pass rendering combining splats with shadow maps from proxy meshes, and automatic pixel-perfect segmentation mask generation.

Result: Hybrid training strategy combining small real dataset with large synthetic data yields best detection and segmentation performance, confirming optimal efficiency for robust model training.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables efficient generation of large-scale, realistic, automatically labeled datasets for robotic vision, with hybrid real+synthetic training as the optimal strategy for achieving accurate models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel pipeline for generating large-scale, highly realistic, and automatically labeled datasets for computer vision tasks in robotic environments. Our approach addresses the critical challenges of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery and the time-consuming bottleneck of manual annotation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create photorealistic representations of the operational environment and objects. These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism. Pixel-perfect segmentation masks are generated automatically and formatted for direct use with object detection models like YOLO. Our experiments show that a hybrid training strategy, combining a small set of real images with a large volume of our synthetic data, yields the best detection and segmentation performance, confirming this as an optimal strategy for efficiently achieving robust and accurate models.

Method: Proposes USTM: a spatio-temporal encoder combining Swin Transformer backbone with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE) to capture both spatial details and short/long-term temporal context from RGB videos.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily datasets against RGB-based and multi-modal approaches, competitive with multi-stream methods, using only RGB input.

Conclusion: USTM demonstrates effective unified spatio-temporal modeling for CSLR, capturing fine-grained features and temporal dependencies without needing multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) requires precise spatio-temporal modeling to accurately recognize sequences of gestures in videos. Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM

Motivation: Existing unexploitable example generation methods have limited practical applicability as they often fail to produce examples that are broadly unexploitable across different real-world computer vision tasks, despite the critical importance of personal data privacy protection.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in generating unexploitable examples that work effectively across various computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: The MCT-UEG framework successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by producing broadly unexploitable examples through meta-learning, enhancing practical applicability for personal data privacy protection.

Abstract: Unexploitable example generation aims to transform personal images into their unexploitable (unlearnable) versions before they are uploaded online, thereby preventing unauthorized exploitation of online personal images. Recently, this task has garnered significant research attention due to its critical relevance to personal data privacy. Yet, despite recent progress, existing methods for this task can still suffer from limited practical applicability, as they can fail to generate examples that are broadly unexploitable across different real-world computer vision tasks. To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose a novel Meta Cross-Task Unexploitable Example Generation (MCT-UEG) framework. At the core of our framework, to optimize the unexploitable example generator for effectively producing broadly unexploitable examples, we design a flat-minima-oriented meta training and testing scheme. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecTok overcomes the dimensionality-quality trade-off in visual tokenizers by using flow semantic distillation and reconstruction-alignment distillation to create high-dimensional semantically-rich latent spaces that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers face a fundamental trade-off between latent space dimensionality and generation quality, forcing them to use low-dimensional spaces. High-dimensional tokenizers underperform despite attempts to enrich semantics with vision foundation models.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Flow semantic distillation - distills semantic information from vision foundation models into forward flow trajectories in flow matching (training space for diffusion transformers), 2) Reconstruction-alignment distillation - enhances semantics with masked feature reconstruction loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on gFID-50K with and without classifier-free guidance, superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. Shows consistent improvements as latent dimensionality increases.

Conclusion: RecTok successfully overcomes the dimensionality-quality trade-off in visual tokenizers, enabling high-dimensional semantically-rich latent spaces that outperform existing methods while maintaining reconstruction fidelity and semantic expressiveness.

Abstract: Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MineTheGap is a method that uses genetic algorithms to automatically mine prompts that expose biases in text-to-image models by optimizing for high bias scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTI models exhibit biases when interpreting ambiguous text prompts, which can have negative societal impacts (e.g., racial stereotypes in occupations) and create redundancy in generated image sets instead of diverse possibilities.

Method: Uses a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts to expose biases. The optimization is driven by a novel bias score that compares the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated text variations of the prompt.

Result: The method successfully mines prompts that cause TTI models to generate biased outputs, with the bias score validated on a dataset with known biases. Code and examples are available.

Conclusion: MineTheGap provides an automated approach for discovering bias-inducing prompts in TTI models, going beyond mere bias detection to actively search for problematic prompts using evolutionary optimization.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models generate images based on text prompts, which often leave certain aspects of the desired image ambiguous. When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations. These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight few-shot learning framework for plant disease detection using MobileNet feature extractors with Bi-LSTM attention classifier, achieving near-SOTA performance with minimal data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for plant disease identification require large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models, making them unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained agricultural environments.

Method: Combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 as feature extractors with feature fusion, followed by a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on relevant features.

Result: Achieved 98.23% accuracy on PlantVillage dataset (15-shot), 69.28% on field images from Dhan Shomadhan dataset, and outperformed previous SOTA with 99.72% accuracy on six diseases using only 15-shot learning. Model size: ~40 MB, inference: ~1.12 GFLOPs.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions, balancing high accuracy with lightweight computational requirements suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of plant leaf diseases is essential for resilient and sustainable agriculture, yet most deep learning approaches rely on large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning. With a compact model size of approximately 40 MB and inference complexity of approximately 1.12 GFLOPs, this work establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions.

TL;DR: IMILIA is an interpretable deep learning framework for predicting and analyzing microscopic inflammation in IBD H&E slides using multiple instance learning and automated tissue characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With IBD treatment shifting toward histologic remission, accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation is crucial for evaluating disease activity and treatment response.

Method: End-to-end framework with inflammation prediction module (MIL model) and interpretability module (HistoPLUS for cell detection/segmentation/classification and EpiSeg for epithelium segmentation).

Result: Achieved cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on discovery cohort, and 0.99/0.84 on two external validation cohorts. Interpretability module revealed biologically consistent patterns: higher-scored tiles had increased immune cell densities, lower-scored tiles contained normal epithelial cells.

Conclusion: IMILIA provides accurate inflammation prediction with biologically interpretable insights, demonstrating consistent performance across datasets and offering potential for clinical IBD assessment.

Abstract: As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.

Motivation: Generative foundation models contain broad visual knowledge but synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations for training data augmentation remains slow, expensive, and incomplete. The paper proposes a more efficient alternative approach.

Method: Using diffusion models at test time to map target images back to the source distribution where the downstream model was trained. This requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. Includes ensemble variant for enhanced robustness.

Achieves substantial relative gains: 137% on BDD100K-Night, 68% on ImageNet-R, and 62% on DarkZurich.

Conclusion: The proposed test-time diffusion approach provides an effective alternative to training data augmentation for domain generalization, offering significant performance improvements while being more efficient and preserving existing task models.

Abstract: Generative foundation models contain broad visual knowledge and can produce diverse image variations, making them particularly promising for advancing domain generalization tasks. While they can be used for training data augmentation, synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations remains slow, expensive, and incomplete.

This approach requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. We demonstrate consistent improvements across segmentation, detection, and classification tasks under challenging environmental shifts in real-to-real domain generalization scenarios with unknown target distributions.

TL;DR: PoseAnything is a universal pose-guided video generation framework that works with both human and non-human characters using arbitrary skeletal inputs, featuring part-level temporal consistency and independent camera motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-guided video generation methods only work with human poses, limiting their application to other subjects. There's a need for a universal framework that can handle various character types and enable better motion control.

Method: 1) Universal framework supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs for both human and non-human characters. 2) Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module for fine-grained consistency by dividing subjects into parts and computing cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames. 3) Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG guidance strategy that enables independent camera movement control by separately injecting motion control into positive and negative anchors. 4) XPose dataset with 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs and automated annotation pipeline.

Result: PoseAnything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization, demonstrating superior performance across various character types.

Conclusion: The proposed PoseAnything framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing pose-guided video generation methods by enabling universal pose handling, improving temporal consistency, and providing independent camera motion control, with strong experimental validation.

Abstract: Pose-guided video generation refers to controlling the motion of subjects in generated video through a sequence of poses. It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native 4K video generation faces quadratic computational explosion from full-attention as resolution increases, making it difficult to balance efficiency and quality. Existing approaches struggle with the computational demands of 2160×3840 resolution.

Method: T3-Video introduces a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism with hierarchical blocking and axis-preserving full-attention design. It transforms pretrained models' attention patterns without altering core architecture, using modest compute and data.

Result: On 4K-VBench, T3-Video outperforms existing approaches with +4.29↑ VQA and +0.08↑ VTC improvements while accelerating native 4K video generation by more than 10× compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: T3-Video demonstrates that efficient native 4K video generation is achievable through strategic attention pattern transformation of pretrained models, offering significant speed and quality improvements without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Native 4K (2160$\times$3840) video generation remains a critical challenge due to the quadratic computational explosion of full-attention as spatiotemporal resolution increases, making it difficult for models to strike a balance between efficiency and quality. This paper proposes a novel Transformer retrofit strategy termed $\textbf{T3}$ ($\textbf{T}$ransform $\textbf{T}$rained $\textbf{T}$ransformer) that, without altering the core architecture of full-attention pretrained models, significantly reduces compute requirements by optimizing their forward logic. Specifically, $\textbf{T3-Video}$ introduces a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism and, via hierarchical blocking together with an axis-preserving full-attention design, can effect an "attention pattern" transformation of a pretrained model using only modest compute and data. Results on 4K-VBench show that $\textbf{T3-Video}$ substantially outperforms existing approaches: while delivering performance improvements (+4.29$\uparrow$ VQA and +0.08$\uparrow$ VTC), it accelerates native 4K video generation by more than 10$\times$.

Conclusion: TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, demonstrating benefits beyond time-awareness including negation-awareness and superior verb/adverb understanding.

Abstract: Our objective is to build a general time-aware video-text embedding model for retrieval. To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical images can be segmented in multiple meaningful ways depending on the application, but existing models either support only a single protocol or require manual prompting, limiting flexibility and efficiency.

Method: Introduces Pancakes framework with a new problem formulation that automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols from unseen domain images while maintaining semantic consistency across related images.

Result: Outperforms existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations that are semantically coherent across images, demonstrated through experiments on seven held-out datasets.

Conclusion: Pancakes addresses a novel segmentation problem by enabling automatic multi-protocol segmentation with semantic consistency, offering a more flexible and efficient approach than current foundation models.

Abstract: A single biomedical image can be meaningfully segmented in multiple ways, depending on the desired application. For instance, a brain MRI can be segmented according to tissue types, vascular territories, broad anatomical regions, fine-grained anatomy, or pathology, etc. Existing automatic segmentation models typically either (1) support only a single protocol, the one they were trained on, or (2) require labor-intensive manual prompting to specify the desired segmentation. We introduce Pancakes, a framework that, given a new image from a previously unseen domain, automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols, while maintaining semantic consistency across related images. Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images.

TL;DR: Proposes H2IAD task for detecting anomalous interactions in collaborative 3D human actions, and introduces IADNet with Temporal Attention Sharing and Distance-Based Relational Encoding modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-person anomaly detection models fail to capture complex human-human interaction dynamics, leading to low accuracy for detecting collaborative behavioral anomalies.

Method: IADNet with Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM) to share motion embeddings across people, Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) for spatial social cues, and normalizing flow for anomaly scoring.

Result: Extensive experiments show IADNet outperforms existing human-centric AD baselines on human-human motion benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the novel H2IAD task by capturing both temporal and spatial dynamics of human interactions through specialized modules.

Abstract: Human-centric anomaly detection (AD) has been primarily studied to specify anomalous behaviors in a single person. However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD.

Motivation: Existing MLLMs are limited to single-step reasoning, and current benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities across modalities.

Method: Proposes MMhops-R1, a multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework using reinforcement learning to optimize dynamic reasoning path planning, query formulation, and multi-level information synthesis.

Result: MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on the MMhops benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to fixed-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The work contributes a challenging benchmark and powerful baseline model for multi-modal multi-hop reasoning, with plans to release code, data, and weights to catalyze future research.

Abstract: The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiMo is a diffusion-based method for spatiotemporal lighting estimation that generates high-frequency details and accurate illuminance by predicting mirrored/diffuse spheres at different exposures and combining them into HDRI maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lighting estimation methods struggle to balance realistic high-frequency detail prediction with accurate illuminance estimation in spatiotemporal contexts. There's a need for better spatial conditioning beyond just depth information.

Method: Fine-tune existing diffusion models on large-scale indoor/outdoor datasets with spatiotemporal light probes. Generate mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures based on 3D positions. Introduce new geometric condition for relative scene-to-target positioning. Combine predictions via differentiable rendering into HDRI maps.

Result: LiMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both spatial control and prediction accuracy, demonstrating superior lighting estimation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the dual challenges of realistic detail and accurate illuminance in spatiotemporal lighting estimation through diffusion priors, novel geometric conditioning, and exposure-aware sphere prediction.

Abstract: We present Lighting in Motion (LiMo), a diffusion-based approach to spatiotemporal lighting estimation. LiMo targets both realistic high-frequency detail prediction and accurate illuminance estimation. To account for both, we propose generating a set of mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures, based on their 3D positions in the input. Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes. For accurate spatial conditioning, we demonstrate that depth alone is insufficient and we introduce a new geometric condition to provide the relative position of the scene to the target 3D position. Finally, we combine diffuse and mirror predictions at different exposures into a single HDRI map leveraging differentiable rendering. We thoroughly evaluate our method and design choices to establish LiMo as state-of-the-art for both spatial control and prediction accuracy.

*Haoyue Zhang,Meera Chappidi,Erolcan Sayar,Helen Richards,Zhijun Chen,Lucas Liu,Roxanne Wadia,Peter A Humphrey,Fady Ghali,Alberto Contreras-Sanz,Peter Black,Jonathan Wright,Stephanie Harmon,Michael Haffner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) improves pathology foundational models for TURBT specimens by addressing domain shift issues without fine-tuning the base model, achieving strong performance in predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response for bladder cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology foundational models (PFMs) have limitations on certain cancer/specimen types due to domain shifts. TURBT specimens for bladder cancer diagnosis contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts not well-represented in PFM pretraining, making them challenging for current MIL frameworks.

Method: Proposed DA-SSL (domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. Uses lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision to enhance PFM-based multiple instance learning pipelines.

Result: DA-SSL achieved AUC of 0.77±0.04 in five-fold cross-validation, and external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, specificity of 0.91 using majority voting for predicting NAC response in TURBT specimens.

Conclusion: Lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks, particularly for domain-shifted specimens like TURBT that were underrepresented in pretraining.

Abstract: Recent deep learning frameworks in histopathology, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL) combined with pathology foundational models (PFMs), have shown strong performance. However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVie 2 is an autoregressive video world model that achieves state-of-the-art long-term video generation with enhanced controllability, visual quality, and temporal consistency through a three-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building video world models with essential properties of controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency represents a challenging but important step toward general spatiotemporal intelligence. Current video generation systems need improvement in these areas for practical world modeling applications.

Method: Three-stage autoregressive training: (1) Multi-modal guidance integrating dense and sparse control signals for improved controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on input frames to bridge training-inference gap for visual quality; (3) History-context guidance aligning contextual information across clips for temporal consistency.

Result: LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, supporting continuous video generation up to five minutes. The authors also introduce LongVGenBench with 100 high-resolution one-minute videos for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: LongVie 2 represents a significant advancement toward unified video world modeling, demonstrating practical long-term video generation capabilities with essential world model properties through its progressive three-stage training approach.

Abstract: Building video world models upon pretrained video generation systems represents an important yet challenging step toward general spatiotemporal intelligence. A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.

*Felix J. Dorfner,Manon A. Dorster,Ryan Connolly,Oscar Gentilhomme,Edward Gibbs,Steven Graham,Seth Wander,Thomas Schultz,Manisha Bahl,Dania Daye,Albert E. Kim,Christopher P. Bridge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBT-DINO is the first foundation model for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, developed using self-supervised learning on 25M+ 2D slices. It outperforms baselines on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction but shows mixed results on lesion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are promising for medical imaging but underexplored for 3D modalities like DBT, which is crucial for breast cancer screening. No existing foundation model exists for DBT despite its clinical importance.

Method: Self-supervised pre-training using DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Evaluated on three downstream tasks: breast density classification, 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, and lesion detection.

Result: DBT-DINO achieved 0.79 accuracy for breast density classification (outperforming baselines), 0.78 AUROC for 5-year risk prediction (comparable to DINOv2), and 0.62 average sensitivity for lesion detection (slightly lower than DINOv2's 0.67). However, DBT-DINO performed better specifically on cancerous lesions (78.8% vs 77.3%).

Conclusion: DBT-DINO is the first foundation model for DBT and demonstrates strong performance on classification and risk prediction tasks. Domain-specific pre-training shows variable benefits, with ImageNet baseline outperforming on general lesion detection, indicating localized detection tasks need further methodological development.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise in medical imaging but remain underexplored for three-dimensional imaging modalities. No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening.
  To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training.
  Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes.
  For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%.
  Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.

Motivation: Addresses a critical gap in vision-language models: understanding and generating physically plausible scene transformations driven by real-world actions. Current models focus on object-level edits but lack true cause-and-effect understanding of physical actions.

Method: Introduces the Do-Undo task and benchmark with a large-scale dataset of reversible actions from real-world videos. Designs a training strategy that enforces consistency for robust action grounding.

Result: Experiments reveal that current models struggle with physical reversibility, highlighting their limitations in understanding true cause-and-effect relationships in the visual world.

Abstract: We introduce the Do-Undo task and benchmark to address a critical gap in vision-language models: understanding and generating physically plausible scene transformations driven by real-world actions. Unlike prior work focused on object-level edits, Do-Undo requires models to simulate the outcome of a physical action and then accurately reverse it, reflecting true cause-and-effect in the visual world. We curate a large-scale dataset of reversible actions from real-world videos and design a training strategy enforcing consistency for robust action grounding. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with physical reversibility, underscoring the importance of this task for embodied AI, robotics, and physics-aware generative modeling.

TL;DR: SCR2-ST is a unified framework that uses single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient spatial transcriptomics data acquisition and accurate expression prediction through reinforcement learning-based active sampling and hybrid regression-retrieval networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is expensive to acquire, and traditional fixed-grid sampling leads to redundant measurements of similar or uninformative regions, resulting in scarce data. Single-cell sequencing data could provide rich biological data as auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation.

Method: SCR2-ST integrates: 1) Single-cell guided reinforcement learning (SCRL) active sampling that combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals for selective acquisition of informative tissue regions; 2) SCR2Net hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network that leverages actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, featuring majority cell-type filtering to suppress noisy matches and using retrieved expression profiles as soft labels for auxiliary supervision.

Result: Evaluated on three public ST datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

Conclusion: SCR2-ST effectively bridges the gap between expensive ST data acquisition and rich single-cell data by providing a unified framework for efficient sampling and accurate prediction, making spatial transcriptomics more accessible and cost-effective.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

TL;DR: MindDrive is a Vision-Language-Action framework that uses an LLM with dual LoRA parameters to enable online reinforcement learning for autonomous driving by converting continuous action spaces into discrete linguistic decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA paradigms in autonomous driving rely on Imitation Learning which suffers from distribution shift and causal confusion. Online RL could address these issues but faces inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces.

Method: MindDrive uses one LLM with two LoRA parameter sets: a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decisions, and an Action Expert that maps linguistic decisions to trajectories. It enables trial-and-error learning over discrete linguistic decisions rather than continuous actions.

Result: Achieves Driving Score of 78.04 and Success Rate of 55.09% on Bench2Drive benchmark, demonstrating strong closed-loop performance. First work to show effectiveness of online RL for VLA models in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: MindDrive effectively balances optimal decision-making, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online RL by operating in linguistic decision space rather than continuous action space.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As diffusion-based AI models produce increasingly realistic videos, there's a growing need for reliable detection methods.

Method: The authors use vanishing points as explicit 3D geometry representations and introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework. They construct a dataset of static scenes for stable feature extraction, and design a transformer with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that 3D geometric consistency, particularly through vanishing point analysis, provides an effective approach for detecting AI-generated videos, with the proposed Grab-3D framework showing superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generation techniques enable AI models to produce highly realistic videos, heightening the need for reliable detection mechanisms. However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection faces challenges due to scarce normal reference samples and subtle, localized defects. Single-pass vision-language models often miss small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns.

Method: AgentIAD uses a tool-driven agentic framework with Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars. The model is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a two-part reward design (perception reward for accuracy/alignment and behavior reward for efficient tool use).

Result: AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on the MMAD dataset, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic framework enables effective multi-stage visual inspection for industrial anomaly detection by combining specialized tools, structured training trajectories, and reinforcement learning, resulting in superior performance and interpretable decision-making.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is difficult due to the scarcity of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of many defects. Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We propose AgentIAD, a tool-driven agentic framework that enables multi-stage visual inspection. The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces.

TL;DR: JoVA is a unified transformer framework for joint video-audio generation that enables lip-synchronized speech without additional alignment modules, using joint self-attention and mouth-area loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-audio generation methods have two key limitations: 1) They can only generate ambient sounds but not human speech synchronized with lip movements, and 2) Current unified approaches rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules that complicate architecture design and reduce transformer simplicity.

Method: JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer for direct cross-modal interaction. It also introduces a mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection to enhance lip-speech synchronization supervision without adding architectural complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments show JoVA outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art unified and audio-driven methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity.

Conclusion: JoVA establishes an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation that addresses key limitations of existing approaches while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present JoVA, a unified framework for joint video-audio generation. Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While image-to-3D generation has advanced, editing AI-generated 3D assets remains difficult. Real applications require easy editing capabilities, which current methods lack.

Method: Adapts ControlNet to image-to-3D generation for text steering in a forward pass. Uses scalable automatic data generation and two-stage training with flow-matching and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: Steer3D follows language instructions more faithfully, maintains better consistency with original 3D assets, and is 2.4x to 28.5x faster than competing methods.

Conclusion: Steer3D demonstrates that text modality can be added to steer pretrained image-to-3D models with only 100k data, enabling practical editing of generated 3D assets.

Abstract: Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

*Tianye Ding,Yiming Xie,Yiqing Liang,Moitreya Chatterjee,Pedro Miraldo,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER converts offline 3D reconstruction models into streaming systems without retraining by aligning predictions across temporal windows using layer-wise scale alignment, achieving SOTA performance with low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward reconstruction models have quadratic memory complexity that prevents streaming video processing. While streaming methods exist, they require extensive retraining and don't fully leverage strong geometric priors of offline models.

Method: Training-free framework that converts offline models to streaming by aligning predictions across consecutive windows. Uses layer-wise scale alignment to address depth scale inconsistencies by segmenting depth predictions into layers, computing per-layer scale factors, and propagating them across windows and timestamps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on RTX A6000 GPU, enabling kilometer-scale streaming video deployment.

Conclusion: LASER enables practical deployment of offline reconstruction models for streaming videos without retraining, solving the memory complexity problem while maintaining high reconstruction quality through novel layer-wise alignment.

Abstract: Recent feed-forward reconstruction models like VGGT and $π^3$ achieve impressive reconstruction quality but cannot process streaming videos due to quadratic memory complexity, limiting their practical deployment. While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

### [200] [I-Scene: 3D Instance Models are Implicit Generalizable Spatial Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13683)
*Lu Ling,Yunhao Ge,Yichen Sheng,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reprogramming a pre-trained 3D instance generator as a scene-level learner enables generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions by leveraging the generator's transferable spatial knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based 3D scene generation approaches are limited by dataset-bounded supervision, restricting generalization to new layouts. The paper aims to overcome this by leveraging pre-trained 3D instance generators as implicit spatial learners.

Method: Reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene-level learner, replacing dataset supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. Use a view-centric formulation of scene space instead of canonical space, creating a fully feed-forward scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model.

Result: The approach enables generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Spatial reasoning emerges even when training scenes are randomly composed objects, demonstrating that the generator's transferable scene prior provides rich learning signals for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from geometric cues.

Conclusion: 3D instance generators are implicit spatial learners and reasoners, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation. The view-centric formulation yields a generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from instance models.

Abstract: Generalization remains the central challenge for interactive 3D scene generation. Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RVM is a recurrent video masked-autoencoder that uses transformer-based RNNs to aggregate image features over time, achieving competitive video and image understanding with high parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient video representation learning approach that captures spatio-temporal structure while being parameter-efficient and capable of handling long temporal sequences without the computational burden of standard spatio-temporal attention architectures.

Method: Uses transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, trained via asymmetric masked prediction with standard pixel reconstruction objective. The recurrent design enables stable feature propagation over long sequences with linear computational cost.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video tasks like action recognition and tracking, while performing favorably against image models (DINOv2) on geometric and spatial understanding tasks. Shows up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders.

Conclusion: RVM provides an efficient "generalist" encoder that learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion, overcoming limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention architectures while maintaining strong performance across both video and image understanding tasks.

Abstract: We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.

### [202] [Towards Scalable Pre-training of Visual Tokenizers for Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687)
*Jingfeng Yao,Yuda Song,Yucong Zhou,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTP addresses the "pre-training scaling problem" in visual tokenizers by optimizing for high-level semantics rather than just pixel-level reconstruction, enabling better scaling and faster convergence in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard visual tokenizer training focuses too much on low-level pixel reconstruction, which doesn't translate to better generative performance despite increased compute. This "pre-training scaling problem" means current approaches waste resources without improving generation quality.

Method: VTP introduces a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework that jointly optimizes image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses to create a latent space that better represents high-level semantics rather than just low-level details.

Result: VTP achieves competitive performance (78.2% zero-shot accuracy, 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) with 4.1× faster convergence on generation. Most importantly, it scales effectively - investing more compute in VTP pre-training yields 65.8% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoders plateau early.

Conclusion: Understanding high-level semantics is crucial for generation, and VTP demonstrates that visual tokenizers can scale effectively with compute when optimized for semantic representation rather than just pixel-level reconstruction, solving the pre-training scaling problem.

Abstract: The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.

### [203] [LitePT: Lighter Yet Stronger Point Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13689)
*Yuanwen Yue,Damien Robert,Jianyuan Wang,Sunghwan Hong,Jan Dirk Wegner,Christian Rupprecht,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LitePT is a new 3D point cloud backbone that uses convolutions in early layers for low-level geometry and switches to attention in deeper layers for high-level semantics, achieving better efficiency than Point Transformer V3 while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud networks combine convolutional layers and attention blocks, but the optimal way to assemble them is unclear. The authors aim to understand the roles of different computational blocks and design a more efficient architecture.

Method: Analyzed role of convolutions vs attention in 3D point cloud networks, found convolutions work well for low-level geometry in early layers while attention is better for high-level semantics in deep layers. Proposed LitePT with convolutions in early stages and attention in deeper layers. Introduced PointROPE, a training-free 3D positional encoding to preserve spatial layout when discarding convolution layers.

Result: LitePT has 3.6× fewer parameters, runs 2× faster, uses 2× less memory than Point Transformer V3, while matching or outperforming it on various tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals intuitive design principles for 3D point cloud networks: use convolutions for early high-resolution geometry extraction and attention for later low-resolution semantic understanding. LitePT demonstrates these principles lead to highly efficient yet powerful architectures.

Abstract: Modern neural architectures for 3D point cloud processing contain both convolutional layers and attention blocks, but the best way to assemble them remains unclear. We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequate to extract low-level geometry at high-resolution in early layers, where attention is expensive without bringing any benefits; attention captures high-level semantics and context in low-resolution, deep layers more efficiently. Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers. To avoid the loss of spatial layout information when discarding redundant convolution layers, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D positional encoding, PointROPE. The resulting LitePT model has $3.6\times$ fewer parameters, runs $2\times$ faster, and uses $2\times$ less memory than the state-of-the-art Point Transformer V3, but nonetheless matches or even outperforms it on a range of tasks and datasets.

*Susung Hong,Chongjian Ge,Zhifei Zhang,Jui-Hsien Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionBrowser is a model-agnostic decoder framework that enables real-time previews during video diffusion generation, allowing interactive control and model probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models are imprecise, slow, and opaque during generation, leaving users waiting without visibility into the generation process.

Method: A lightweight decoder framework that generates multi-modal previews (RGB and scene intrinsics) at any denoising timestep or transformer block, achieving 4× real-time speed.

Result: Enables interactive generation guidance via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, and allows systematic probing of how scene and object details are composed during denoising.

Conclusion: DiffusionBrowser provides real-time previews and interactive control for video diffusion models, making the generation process transparent and controllable.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.
