### [1] [Self-Supervised Masked Autoencoders with Dense-Unet for Coronary Calcium Removal in limited CT Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02392)
*Mo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense-MAE: A self-supervised MAE framework for volumetric medical data that improves coronary calcification artifact removal in CTA by pre-training Dense-Unet with random 3D patch masking, enhancing inpainting accuracy especially in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in CTA that hinder stenosis diagnosis. While DCNNs like Dense-Unet can remove these artifacts, they require large labeled datasets which are scarce in medical imaging. There's a need for methods that can learn from limited labeled data.

Method: Proposed Dense-MAE: a self-supervised learning framework inspired by MAE for 3D point clouds. Randomly masks 3D patches of vessel lumen and trains Dense-Unet to reconstruct missing geometry. This pre-training forces encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation.

Result: Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets show that initializing calcium removal network with MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Dense-MAE provides an effective self-supervised pre-training strategy for volumetric medical data that enhances performance of calcium artifact removal networks, especially when labeled data is limited, addressing a key challenge in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), severely hampering the diagnosis of lumen stenosis. While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.

### [2] [MIAR: Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation Fuison for Multimodal Emotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02414)
*Jichao Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIAR is a novel multimodal emotion recognition method that addresses modality distribution differences and varying contributions through feature interaction tokens and contrastive learning alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MER methods focus on modal fusion but inadequately address significant distributional differences among modalities and their varying contributions to emotion recognition. They also lack robust generalization across diverse textual model features, limiting performance in multimodal scenarios.

Method: MIAR (Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation) integrates contextual features across modalities using feature interaction to generate four tokens representing global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. It aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

Result: Experimental results on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks demonstrate that MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.

Conclusion: MIAR effectively addresses modality distribution differences and varying contributions through its interaction and alignment approach, achieving superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions through three modes: language, vision, and audio. Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task. They also lacked robust generalization capabilities across diverse textual model features, thus limiting performance in multimodal scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, experimental results demonstrate the MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.

### [3] [Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multi-channel and Symmetric Mutual Promotion Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02415)
*Wangyuan Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal sentiment analysis method using multi-channel feature extraction and a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion approach to address limitations in current multimodal sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal sentiment analysis faces two main challenges: 1) limited and insufficiently rich features from single modality data, and 2) most studies focus only on inter-modal feature consistency while neglecting feature differences, leading to inadequate feature fusion.

Method: 1) Extract multi-channel features (dual-channel for visual and auditory modalities) for comprehensive intra-modal representation. 2) Propose SMP inter-modal feature fusion combining symmetric cross-modal attention (captures useful info from other modalities) and self-attention (models contextual info). 3) Integrate intra-modal features with inter-modal fused features to leverage complementarity while considering differences.

Result: Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis by enhancing intra-modal feature representation and improving inter-modal feature fusion through symmetric mutual promotion, leading to better performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is a key technology in the fields of human-computer interaction and affective computing. Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

*Wenting Lu,Didi Zhu,Tao Shen,Donglin Zhu,Ayong Ye,Chao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoT framework addresses multi-modal reasoning limitations by using dynamic multi-region grounding and relation-aware reasoning, achieving significant accuracy improvements on visual reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought methods for multi-modal reasoning have two critical limitations: over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions and semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps, which hinder effective cross-modal reasoning.

Method: Proposes CoCoT (Collaborative Cross-modal Thought) framework with two key innovations: 1) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect relevant image regions based on questions, and 2) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration through iterative visual cue alignment for coherent reasoning chains.

Result: Created CoCoT-70K dataset with 74,691 high-quality samples featuring multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Achieved average accuracy improvements of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual reasoning by addressing cross-modal limitations through collaborative multi-region grounding and relation-aware reasoning, with publicly available data and code for further research.

Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) framework, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively aligning visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual reasoning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.

### [6] [TAP-ViTs: Task-Adaptive Pruning for On-Device Deployment of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02437)
*Zhibo Wang,Zuoyuan Zhang,Xiaoyi Pang,Qile Zhang,Xuanyi Hao,Shuguo Zhuo,Peng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAP-ViTs is a privacy-preserving task-adaptive pruning framework for Vision Transformers that generates device-specific pruned models without accessing raw local data, using GMM-based metric datasets and dual-granularity importance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high computational/memory demands that hinder deployment on mobile/edge devices. Existing pruning methods either produce a single model ignoring device heterogeneity, or require fine-tuning with local data which violates privacy constraints and is infeasible on resource-limited devices.

Method: 1) GMM-based metric dataset construction: Each device fits a lightweight Gaussian Mixture Model to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only GMM parameters. Cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct task-representative metric datasets. 2) Dual-granularity importance evaluation: Jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance for fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

Conclusion: TAP-ViTs enables privacy-preserving, device-specific ViT pruning for mobile/edge computing by using GMM-based data approximation and dual-granularity importance evaluation, addressing both device heterogeneity and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

### [7] [Understanding Pure Textual Reasoning for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02441)
*Yuan Li,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how textual information contributes to Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) by comparing three paradigms (Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, Autoencoder) for learning image-text-score relationships, finding Self-Consistency most effective at closing the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While textual reasoning has been widely adopted in BIQA, it remains unclear how textual information actually contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent score-related image contents. The authors aim to address these fundamental questions about the role of text in BIQA.

Method: The authors analyze BIQA from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing models with three designed paradigms: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. These paradigms are specifically designed to learn the image-text-score relationship in different ways.

Result: Experiments show that existing models' performance significantly drops when using only textual information. Chain-of-Thought introduces little improvement, while Self-Consistency significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions (narrowing PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03). Autoencoder is less effective but reveals optimization directions.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into improving textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks, with Self-Consistency emerging as the most effective paradigm for closing the image-text gap in quality prediction.

Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

### [8] [Evaluating the Diagnostic Classification Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Insights from the Osteoarthritis Initiative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02443)
*Li Wang,Xi Chen,XiangWen Deng,HuaHui Yi,ZeKun Jiang,Kang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs underperform in knee OA classification compared to vision encoders alone, with LLMs better suited as interpreters than classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate MLLM performance on underrepresented knee OA classification, which affects 300-400M people worldwide, and understand architectural limitations for medical diagnostic tasks requiring high certainty.

Method: Systematic ablation studies manipulating vision encoder, connector, and LLM components across diverse training strategies on knee OA radiograph datasets (500 balanced vs 5,778 imbalanced images).

Result: Vision encoder alone outperformed full MLLM pipelines; LLM fine-tuning provided no improvement over prompting; small balanced dataset (500 images) outperformed larger imbalanced set (5,778 images).

Conclusion: For domain-specific medical classification, LLMs function better as interpreters/report generators than primary classifiers; MLLM architecture is less suitable for high-certainty diagnostic tasks, recommending vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.

### [9] [A Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Approach For High-Resolution Gridded Monsoon Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02445)
*Parashjyoti Borah,Sanghamitra Sarkar,Ranjan Phukan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework treats monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task, using CNN architecture to forecast high-resolution gridded rainfall patterns from pre-monsoon atmospheric data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monsoon forecasting provides only spatially-averaged seasonal values, lacking the spatial detail needed for regional resource management. There's a critical need for high-resolution predictions to support agriculture, economy, and water security for over a billion people affected by the Indian Summer Monsoon.

Method: The approach reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. Multi-variable pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields are treated as sequences of multi-channel images (video-like input tensors). A CNN-based architecture learns the mapping from five-month pre-monsoon data (January-May) to high-resolution gridded rainfall patterns using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets.

Result: The framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.

Conclusion: The novel deep learning approach effectively addresses the spatial detail limitation of traditional monsoon forecasting, providing high-resolution gridded predictions that can support regional-level resource management and decision-making for the Indian Summer Monsoon.

Abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is a critical climate phenomenon, fundamentally impacting the agriculture, economy, and water security of over a billion people. Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.

### [10] [Don't Mind the Gaps: Implicit Neural Representations for Resolution-Agnostic Retinal OCT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02447)
*Bennet Kahrs,Julia Andresen,Fenja Falta,Monty Santarossa,Heinz Handels,Timo Kepp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INR-based frameworks for dense 3D analysis of anisotropic retinal OCT volumes using resolution-agnostic implicit neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical OCT imaging has large slice spacing (anisotropic), forcing most methods to use 2D approaches that risk inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans and can't handle different imaging protocols.

Method: Two INR-based frameworks: 1) Inter-B-scan interpolation incorporating en-face modality information to retain structures between B-scans, and 2) Resolution-agnostic retinal atlas for general analysis without strict data requirements. Both use generalizable INRs with population-based training.

Result: Resolution-independent frameworks enable analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, allowing volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies despite anisotropic data.

Conclusion: INR-based approaches overcome limitations of anisotropic OCT data, providing consistent 3D analysis and opening possibilities for volumetric retinal evaluation in clinical settings.

Abstract: Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.

*Souhail Hadgi,Bingchen Gong,Ramana Sundararaman,Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Peter Wonka,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D encoder model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds, enabling zero-shot 3D part segmentation without expensive multi-view rendering or LLM prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D foundation models are good at global tasks but poor at local part-level reasoning. Existing approaches rely on expensive multi-view rendering, LLM prompt engineering, and fail to exploit inherent 3D geometry.

Method: Two-stage training of a point cloud transformer encoder: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders (DINOv2) into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings using multi-positive contrastive objective.

Result: Achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference, significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D encoder effectively bridges the gap in local part-level reasoning for 3D shapes by directly processing point clouds, eliminating the need for expensive multi-view rendering while leveraging existing 2D vision-language foundation models.

Abstract: Current foundation models for 3D shapes excel at global tasks (retrieval, classification) but transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning. Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

*Amirreza Parvahan,Mohammad Hoseyni,Javad Khoramdel,Amirhossein Nikoofard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight 3D medical imaging framework reformulates CT scans as video streams for efficient intracranial hemorrhage detection on edge devices, using YOLO for slice detection and ByteTrack for anatomical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Volumetric medical imaging analysis on edge devices is constrained by high memory/computational demands of 3D CNNs. Need efficient solution for time-sensitive ICH detection in resource-constrained environments like mobile stroke units.

Method: Reformulate CT data as sequential video streams. Benchmark YOLO architectures (v8-v12 Nano) for slice-level detection. Use ByteTrack for anatomical consistency across z-axis. Add hybrid inference strategy and spatiotemporal consistency filter to address tracker initialization lag.

Result: Framework increases detection precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to baseline 2D detector while maintaining high sensitivity. Provides 3D contextual reasoning at fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: Video-viewpoint paradigm offers scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient 3D medical imaging analysis on edge devices.

Abstract: Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.

*Shaden Shaar,Bradon Thymes,Sirawut Chaixanien,Claire Cardie,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MovieRecapsQA: A novel open-ended multimodal VideoQA benchmark using movie recap videos with synchronized visual and textual content, featuring ≈8.2K QA pairs and explicit textual context for reference-free evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoQA benchmarks fail to capture complex multimodal reasoning needed for real-world videos like movies, and are largely not open-ended due to difficulties in evaluating free-form answers.

Method: Created benchmark using movie recap videos from YouTube that summarize films through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Generated ≈8.2K QA pairs aligned with movie subtitles, providing necessary "facts" for reference-free evaluation. Includes videos of multiple lengths and categorized questions by modality and type.

Result: Evaluation of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed: 1) visual-only questions remain most challenging, 2) models default to textual inputs when available, 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is difficult for all models, and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

Conclusion: MovieRecapsQA is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark with explicit textual context for evaluation, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal reasoning capabilities and revealing significant challenges in visual understanding for current models.

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos such as movies requires integrating visual and dialogue cues to answer complex questions. Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary "facts" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using Vision Mamba and Guided Graph Neural Network for localizing manipulations in both shallowfake and deepfake images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image manipulation localization is critical due to societal impacts of forged images. While many studies focus on either shallowfakes (traditional editing) or deepfakes (AI-generated), few address both cases. There's a need for a unified approach to localize manipulations across both types of forged images.

Method: Uses Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. Proposes a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module to further amplify the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels.

Result: The proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods for localizing manipulations in both shallowfake and deepfake images.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning networks to localize manipulations across both shallowfake and deepfake images, providing a unified solution for image manipulation detection with improved accuracy.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization is a critical research task, given that forged images may have a significant societal impact of various aspects. Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

*Aniruddha Mahapatra,Long Mai,Cusuh Ham,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamLoop is a controllable video synthesis framework that generates cinemagraphs (photos with selective looping motion) from single photos without requiring cinemagraph training data, using adapted video diffusion models with temporal bridging and motion conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for generating cinemagraphs are limited to simple motions and narrow domains (like water/smoke), while general video diffusion models lack specialized data and constraints needed for seamless, controlled loops required in cinemagraphs.

Method: Adapts a general video diffusion model by training on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. During inference: (1) uses input image as both first- and last-frame condition to enforce seamless loops, (2) conditions on static tracks to maintain static background, (3) uses user-specified motion paths for target objects to control animation trajectory and timing.

Result: Produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches. First method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls.

Conclusion: DreamLoop successfully addresses the challenge of controllable cinemagraph generation from single photos without specialized training data, enabling flexible artistic control over motion in general scenes while maintaining seamless loops and static backgrounds.

Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.

*Shuman He,Xiehua Li,Xioaju Yang,Yang Xiong,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRRE method uses green channel removal reconstruction error to detect AI-generated images with strong cross-model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative models, making them ineffective against rapidly evolving synthetic image technologies.

Method: Proposes G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE) - removes green channel from images and analyzes reconstruction errors, which differ significantly between real and AI-generated images.

Result: GRRE achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models (including unseen ones), maintains robustness against perturbations/post-processing, and shows superior cross-model generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Channel-removal-based reconstruction is a powerful forensic tool for detecting AI-generated images, offering strong generalization capabilities for safeguarding image authenticity in the generative AI era.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is challenging due to pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, typically requiring category-specific parametric templates which limit generalization.

Method: Uses morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly optimize shape and pose, alleviating shape-pose ambiguities.

Result: Superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, enabling faithful motion transfer across diverse categories and casual video scenarios.

Conclusion: CAMO advances motion transfer by eliminating need for predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision, making it applicable to varied object categories and real-world video inputs.

Abstract: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is a challenging problem, due to inherent pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, often requiring category-specific parametric templates. We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, significantly advancing motion transfer in varied object categories and casual video scenarios.

*Guoquan Zheng,Jie Hao,Huiyu Duan,Yongming Han,Liang Yuan,Dong Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

TL;DR: A robust framework for acquiring high-fidelity 3D mesh saliency ground truth using view cone sampling and hybrid constrained diffusion to address limitations of current VR eye-tracking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition methods ignore differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image arrays, and VR eye-tracking pipelines suffer from texture attention bias and signal leakage across gaps due to single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing.

Method: Two key components: 1) View Cone Sampling (VCS) strategy using Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to simulate human foveal receptive field for robust sampling of complex topologies, and 2) Hybrid Manifold-Euclidean Constrained Diffusion (HCD) algorithm that fuses manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales for topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

Result: The framework mitigates "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, providing a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses fundamental limitations in current 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition by better simulating human visual perception mechanisms and handling complex 3D topologies, establishing a more reliable foundation for human-centric visual modeling in VR applications.

Abstract: Reliable 3D mesh saliency ground truth (GT) is essential for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality (VR). However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

### [19] [Foreground-Aware Dataset Distillation via Dynamic Patch Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02727)
*Longzhen Li,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foreground-aware dataset distillation method that improves patch selection using Grounded SAM2 to identify main objects and adaptively select patches based on foreground occupancy, preserving key object information while reducing background redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dataset distillation methods have limitations: optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and produce unrealistic images, while recent non-optimization methods use rigid patch selection that discards critical object information. There's a need for more efficient and informative dataset distillation that preserves key foreground object details.

Method: Uses Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy. Derives category-wise patch decision thresholds, then implements dynamic patch selection: either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or resizes the full image when foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves key object information while reducing background redundancy.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show consistent improvement over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets with enhanced robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

Conclusion: The proposed foreground-aware dataset distillation method effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches by adaptively selecting patches based on foreground object information, leading to better distillation performance and more useful synthetic datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A homography-guided pose estimator network for visual localization between multi-view images and SD maps that uses geometric priors to improve training efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based visual localization methods on SD maps overlook geometric priors, leading to poor training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. There's a need to incorporate geometric constraints to improve performance.

Method: Proposes a homography-guided pose estimator network that: 1) Constructs input pairs satisfying homography constraints by projecting ground-view features to BEV domain, 2) Enforces semantic alignment between image and map features, 3) Uses homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict pose outputs to valid feasible regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset show the approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. The method also naturally supports cross-resolution inputs due to explicit homography modeling.

Conclusion: This is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. The homography-guided approach improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression methods.

Abstract: Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with functional imaging like PET scans due to a "functional perception gap" - they can't interpret tracer biodistribution without morphological priors. The authors create PET-Bench (52K QA pairs), discover "CoT hallucination trap" where reasoning prompts produce ungrounded diagnoses, and propose AVA fine-tuning to fix this, improving accuracy by 14.83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at anatomical imaging but have unexplored limitations in functional imaging like PET scans. There's a fundamental "functional perception gap" where vision encoders can't decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors, creating safety hazards in clinical diagnosis.

Method: 1) Created PET-Bench - first large-scale functional imaging benchmark with 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. 2) Evaluated 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs, identifying "Chain-of-Thought hallucination trap." 3) Proposed Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA) - a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces mastery of low-level functional perception before high-level diagnostic reasoning.

Result: Standard CoT prompting paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool, improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Conclusion: Functional imaging presents unique challenges for MLLMs that aren't present in anatomical imaging. The CoT hallucination trap reveals safety hazards in clinical applications. AVA provides a solution by enforcing proper visual grounding before reasoning, making MLLMs more reliable for functional imaging diagnosis.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BUFFER-X is a training-free point cloud registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse datasets without manual tuning or retraining, addressing limitations of fixed parameters, learned detectors, and scale mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. Three key limitations are identified: fixed user-defined parameters that don't generalize across scales, poor cross-domain transferability of learned keypoint detectors, and absolute coordinates amplifying scale mismatches between datasets.

Method: BUFFER-X addresses these issues through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization for scale consistency. The approach uses hierarchical multi-scale matching across local, middle, and global receptive fields. BUFFER-X-Lite adds efficiency improvements through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers.

Result: The framework was evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark of 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate effective generalization without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains. BUFFER-X-Lite reduces total computation time by 43% relative to BUFFER-X while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: BUFFER-X provides a robust, training-free solution for point cloud registration that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse environments, addressing key limitations of existing deep learning approaches. The framework eliminates the need for dataset-specific tuning or retraining while maintaining accuracy and offering efficient variants for time-critical applications.

Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular depth estimation methods rely on large-scale datasets and complex decoders, limiting efficiency and generalization. Need for lightweight, data-centric approach for zero-shot depth estimation.

Method: 1) Use DINOv3 as visual encoder for high-quality dense features. 2) Design Simple Depth Transformer (SDT) decoder with single-path feature fusion and upsampling to reduce computational overhead. 3) Implement quality-based filtering strategy to remove harmful training samples and reduce dataset size.

Result: Framework surpasses DPT accuracy on five benchmarks while reducing parameters by 85-89%. Quality filtering improves training quality with smaller dataset. Demonstrates efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation.

Conclusion: Balancing model design and data quality is crucial for efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. The proposed lightweight framework with SDT decoder and data filtering achieves superior performance with significantly reduced complexity.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to recover the depth information of 3D scenes from 2D images. Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClearAIR is a novel All-in-One Image Restoration framework inspired by Human Visual Perception that uses hierarchical coarse-to-fine restoration with MLLM-based quality assessment, region awareness, and internal clue reuse for superior performance on complex degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, which often lead to oversmoothing and artifacts. The authors aim to address these limitations by developing a more robust framework that can handle complex, composite degradations in real-world scenarios.

Method: ClearAIR uses a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy inspired by Human Visual Perception: 1) MLLM-based Image Quality Assessment for overall evaluation with cross-modal understanding, 2) Region awareness and task recognition pipeline with semantic cross-attention and degradation-aware modules for local restoration, and 3) Internal clue reuse mechanism for self-supervised fine detail recovery.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ClearAIR presents an effective AiOIR framework that overcomes limitations of degradation-specific methods through HVP-inspired hierarchical restoration, achieving better handling of complex real-world degradations with reduced artifacts and improved detail preservation.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Boyu Chang,Qi Wang,Xi Guo,Zhixiong Nan,Yazhou Yao,Tianfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AbductiveMLLM enhances visual abductive reasoning in MLLMs by mimicking human dual-mode cognition with verbal reasoning and visual imagination components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have strong general multimodal reasoning but lack human-like abductive inference capabilities for incomplete visual observations. The paper aims to bridge this gap by drawing inspiration from human cognition where verbal and pictorial abduction work together.

Method: Proposes AbductiveMLLM with two synergistic components: REASONER (verbal domain) that explores explanations using a blind LLM, prunes visually incongruent hypotheses via cross-modal causal alignment, and introduces targeted priors to MLLM; and IMAGINER (pictorial domain) that uses text-to-image diffusion to "imagine" plausible visual scenes corresponding to verbal explanations, enriching contextual grounding. Both components are trained jointly end-to-end.

Result: Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: The dual-mode approach mimicking human verbal-pictorial abduction effectively enhances MLLMs' abductive reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the value of cognitive-inspired architectures for complex multimodal inference tasks.

Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to "imagine" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

TL;DR: EarthVLNet: A progressive Earth vision-language framework with EarthVLSet dataset (10.9k RS images + 761.5k text pairs) for semantic segmentation and VQA tasks, using object semantics to guide relational reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth vision lacks object-relational reasoning capabilities, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. Current approaches focus on object recognition but miss the relationships between objects needed for applications like city planning.

Method: Progressive framework with EarthVLSet dataset (sub-meter RS images, land-cover masks, text pairs) and EarthVLNet network. Two-stage approach: 1) land-cover segmentation for object semantics, 2) object-aware LLM guided by pixel-wise semantics for relational reasoning and VQA. Uses numerical difference loss for optimization.

Result: Superior performance on three benchmarks: semantic segmentation, multiple-choice VQA, and open-ended VQA. Key findings: segmentation features enhance VQA even cross-dataset; multiple-choice tasks sensitive to vision encoder; open-ended tasks need advanced vision+language models.

Conclusion: The framework connects "image-mask-text" for comprehensive Earth scene understanding, advancing geographical applications. Provides benchmark for Earth vision-language tasks with implications for city planning and relational reasoning in remote sensing.

Abstract: Earth vision has achieved milestones in geospatial object recognition but lacks exploration in object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision.

*Mengtian Li,Jinshu Chen,Songtao Zhao,Wanquan Feng,Pengqi Tu,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamStyle is a unified video stylization framework supporting text, image, and first-frame guidance with improved style consistency and reduced flicker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stylization methods are limited to single style conditions (text, image, or first frame only) and suffer from style inconsistency and temporal flicker due to lack of high-quality datasets.

Method: Built on vanilla Image-to-Video model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) using token-specific up matrices to reduce confusion among different condition tokens, plus a well-designed data curation pipeline for high-quality paired video data.

Result: DreamStyle demonstrates competence in all three video stylization tasks (text-guided, style-image-guided, first-frame-guided) and outperforms competitors in style consistency and video quality.

Conclusion: DreamStyle provides a unified solution for diverse video stylization needs with improved quality and consistency through innovative architecture and data curation.

Abstract: Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.

### [29] [Textile IR: A Bidirectional Intermediate Representation for Physics-Aware Fashion CAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02792)
*Petteri Teikari,Neliana Fuenmayor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Textile IR is a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects CAD, physics simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design, enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously through a seven-layer Verification Ladder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fashion design tools are siloed - pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but doesn't understand drape, while physics simulation predicts behavior but can't automatically fix patterns. There's also a compound uncertainty problem where measurement errors, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine to make sustainability claims unreliable.

Method: Textile IR provides semantic integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). It uses a scene-graph representation that enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays, with formal constraint satisfaction over three domains.

Result: The framework enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. It makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential.

Conclusion: Textile IR addresses the compound uncertainty problem in fashion engineering and enables designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping. The paper proposes six research priorities and discusses deployment for fashion SMEs.

Abstract: We introduce Textile IR, a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects manufacturing-valid CAD, physics-based simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design. Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements. Key contribution: a formal representation that makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential -- enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableDPT adapts image-based depth estimation models for video by adding temporal layers with cross-attention to keyframes, achieving stable depth predictions with faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models applied to video sequences suffer from temporal instability and flickering artifacts, creating poor viewing experiences.

Method: Builds on Vision Transformer encoder and DPT head, adding temporal layers with efficient cross-attention to integrate information from keyframes across entire video sequence. Includes novel inference strategy for arbitrary-length videos.

Result: Improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance, and 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: StableDPT effectively adapts image-based depth models for video with minimal training overhead, achieving stable, accurate depth predictions with efficient processing.

Abstract: Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel topology-aware framework for virtual staining that converts H&E images to IHC images using graph contrastive learning and topological constraints to handle spatial misalignments in weakly-paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is crucial for cancer diagnosis but is complex, time-consuming, and expensive compared to H&E staining. Virtual staining offers a cost-effective alternative, but existing methods struggle with weakly-paired data from adjacent slides that have spatial misalignments and local deformations.

Method: Proposes a topology-aware framework with two key mechanisms: 1) Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) using graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, and 2) Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed topology-aware framework effectively addresses the challenges of weakly-paired data in virtual staining, providing a robust solution for converting H&E to IHC images with improved clinical utility.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides crucial molecular characterization of tissue samples and plays an indispensable role in the clinical examination and diagnosis of cancers. However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Dongzhan Zhou,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchThinker-R1 reduces reasoning token costs by 64% while maintaining accuracy by teaching multimodal models to use concise, goal-directed sketch-style reasoning instead of lengthy step-by-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long reasoning processes in multimodal models incur high computational overhead (token costs and response time), while humans use efficient sketch-style reasoning that prioritizes salient information for faster problem-solving.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Sketch-Mode Cold Start - convert standard reasoning to sketch-style and finetune base model, 2) Train SketchJudge Reward Model to evaluate and score sketch-style reasoning, 3) Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning supervised by SketchJudge to generalize sketch-style reasoning ability.

Result: Achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy across four benchmarks. Qualitative analysis shows sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

Conclusion: SketchThinker-R1 successfully enables multimodal models to adopt efficient sketch-style reasoning, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating the value of human-inspired cognitive efficiency in AI systems.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

TL;DR: DGA-Net adapts SAM for Camouflaged Object Detection using dense depth prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully exploit depth cues in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), as existing approaches primarily rely on sparse prompts like points or boxes, which may not fully capture depth information.

Method: Proposes DGA-Net with two key modules: 1) Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometry in a heterogeneous graph for unified guidance, and 2) Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) creates a global anchor and establishes non-local pathways to broadcast guidance from deep to shallow layers, countering feature hierarchy decay.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that DGA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art COD methods.

Conclusion: The novel "depth prompting" paradigm and DGA-Net framework effectively leverage depth cues for improved camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: To fully exploit depth cues in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), we present DGA-Net, a specialized framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) via a novel ``depth prompting" paradigm. Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.

TL;DR: SEF-DETR improves infrared small target detection by addressing background feature dominance in DETR-based detectors through frequency-guided patch screening, dynamic embedding enhancement, and reliability-consistency-aware fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based detectors suffer performance degradation in infrared small target detection because target-relevant embeddings get overwhelmed by dominant background features due to self-attention, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate localization.

Method: Proposes SEF-DETR with three components: 1) Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS) uses Fourier spectrum to create target-relevant density maps and suppress background features; 2) Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE) strengthens multi-scale representations in target-aware manner; 3) Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF) refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection.

Conclusion: SEF-DETR effectively addresses the background feature dominance problem in DETR-based infrared small target detection through novel query initialization refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation that predicts full segmentation holistically without mask-based frameworks, introducing key adaptations for discrete data and showing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal image segmentation framework that doesn't depend on traditional mask-based approaches, enabling holistic segmentation prediction and principled ambiguity modeling that current mask-based models lack.

Method: Uses diffusion models adapted for discrete segmentation data with key innovations: location-aware palette with 2D gray code ordering, tanh activation for discrete data, sigmoid loss weighting optimization, and x-prediction approach.

Result: The model narrows the performance gap with leading mask-based architectures while introducing unique capabilities like principled ambiguity modeling. Current performance doesn't yet surpass state-of-the-art mask-based models but shows promising potential.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based framework demonstrates viability for universal image segmentation, with proposed improvements combined with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning potentially leading to competitive models in the future.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.

TL;DR: TA-Prompting enhances VideoLLMs with Temporal Anchors for precise event localization and temporal-aware video understanding, plus event coherent sampling for better caption coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs struggle with identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing generated captions to be poorly grounded temporally.

Method: Proposes TA-Prompting with Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt VideoLLMs for temporal-aware understanding, plus event coherent sampling strategy for selecting coherent event captions.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets for dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

Conclusion: TA-Prompting effectively addresses temporal grounding challenges in VideoLLMs, improving dense video captioning and temporal understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IQA methods either provide numerical scores without explanation or low-level descriptions without precise scores. Recent VLM-based IQA methods show promise but suffer from unreliable reasoning due to limited integration of visual and textual cues.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Supervised fine-tuning on Grounded-Rationale-IQA dataset to teach region grounding, and 2) Reinforcement learning with KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning collapse and Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias.

Result: Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. Application to downstream tasks like image restoration demonstrates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed Zoom-IQA model successfully emulates key cognitive behaviors for IQA, addressing limitations of previous methods through explicit uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.

*Aihua Zheng,Ya Gao,Shihao Li,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCG-ReID proposes a disentangled fusion framework for multi-modal vehicle ReID that dynamically handles balanced and unbalanced quality distributions via separate collaboration and guidance fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal vehicle ReID methods use a single fusion model for all data, failing to address the distinct needs of balanced vs. unbalanced quality distributions across RGB, NIR, and TIR modalities, which creates conflicts between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity.

Method: DCG-ReID introduces: 1) Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) to dynamically reweight modal contributions, 2) Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) for balanced distributions to mine pairwise consensus features, and 3) Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) for unbalanced distributions to amplify dominant modality advantages and guide auxiliary modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The disentangled fusion framework successfully addresses the conflicting requirements of different quality distributions in multi-modal vehicle ReID, improving performance by separating balanced and unbalanced scenarios with specialized fusion strategies.

Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: PrismVAU is a lightweight real-time Video Anomaly Understanding system that uses a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring and explanation without fine-tuning or external modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAU approaches rely on fine-tuned MLLMs or external modules like video captioners, which require costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead.

Method: Two-stage system: (1) coarse anomaly scoring via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) MLLM-based refinement with system/user prompts. Uses weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering to optimize textual anchors and prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations without instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, external modules, or dense processing.

Conclusion: PrismVAU provides an efficient and practical solution for real-world VAU applications by eliminating costly requirements while maintaining performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual solar panel inspections are tedious, costly, and error-prone. Existing deep learning methods are either too large for edge devices or suffer from biased accuracy estimation due to ineffective learning techniques.

Method: Proposed HybridSolarNet integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Used tight split-before-augmentation protocol to avoid data leakage, implemented focal loss for class imbalance, and applied cosine annealing. Evaluated on Kaggle Solar Panel Images dataset with 5-fold stratified cross-validation.

Result: Achieved 92.37% ± 0.41 average accuracy and F1-score of 0.9226 ± 0.39, requiring only 16.3 MB storage (32× smaller than VGG19). Inference speed of 54.9 FPS with GPU support. Ablation studies showed CBAM contributed +1.53% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: HybridSolarNet is a lightweight, accurate model suitable for real-time UAV-based solar panel monitoring, with visualization showing it focuses on relevant fault locations rather than irrelevant areas.

Abstract: Manual inspections for solar panel systems are a tedious, costly, and error-prone task, making it desirable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based monitoring. Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones.

TL;DR: A novel comic reasoning framework improves small MLLMs' performance on comic VQA by addressing CoT limitations through modular generation, GRPO-based fine-tuning, and structured rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Chain-of-Thought prompting degrades performance in Comic VQA, especially for small MLLMs, due to state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Proposes a comic reasoning framework combining modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward to produce faithful and transferable reasoning chains.

Result: The 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five challenging benchmarks, with plug-in experiments yielding additional 12.1% average improvement across different MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CoT limitations in comic reasoning tasks and demonstrates strong performance on humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks beyond comic VQA.

Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiSe is a vehicle-infrastructure collaborative perception framework that reduces communication bandwidth by 99.29% while maintaining SOTA detection accuracy through risk-intent selective feature transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICP systems face a critical bottleneck in balancing communication bandwidth and feature redundancy. Existing approaches inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions, wasting bandwidth on unimportant information.

Method: Proposes Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe) with two key components: 1) Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) using potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks, and 2) Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leveraging ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key BEV areas. Implements semantic-selective fusion that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on DeepAccident dataset show RiSe reduces communication volume to 0.71% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

Conclusion: RiSe successfully addresses the bandwidth-feature redundancy trade-off in VICP by shifting from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones, effectively acting as a feature denoiser that transmits only essential information for decision-making.

Abstract: Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

*Yihan Wei,Shenghai Yuan,Tianchen Deng,Boyang Lou,Enwen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCCur is a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels for corner-case scenarios using a multi-agent recursive pipeline with minimal human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases (rare/extreme scenarios causing real-world failures) are difficult to curate at scale due to noisy web data, brittle labels, and edge deployment constraints that preclude large retraining.

Method: Three-stage recursive pipeline: 1) Large-scale data acquisition/filtering with VLMs and tri-modal consistency checks, 2) Mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation with complementary encoders and uncertainty sampling, 3) Region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling with proposer-validator architecture.

Result: ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, requires minimal human supervision, and provides practical substrate for downstream training/evaluation under resource constraints.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable curation of corner-case datasets from noisy web imagery with auditable fine-grained labels, addressing resource constraints while maintaining high precision.

Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: SA-ResGS improves active scene reconstruction by stabilizing uncertainty quantification and enhancing supervision for next-best-view selection using self-augmented point clouds and residual learning for 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active scene reconstruction methods suffer from unreliable uncertainty quantification and poor supervision for next-best-view selection, especially with sparse and wide-baseline views that lead to under-supervised Gaussians.

Method: Proposes Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting with: (1) Self-Augmented point clouds via triangulation between training and extrapolated views for coverage estimation, (2) First residual learning strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting with uncertainty-driven filtering and sampling, (3) Physically guided view selection for uniform scene coverage.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness for active view selection tasks.

Conclusion: SA-ResGS successfully addresses uncertainty quantification stability and supervision challenges in active scene reconstruction through self-augmentation and residual learning, enabling more efficient and robust next-best-view planning.

Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.

*Ali Kashefi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks (Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet) that predict fluid flow variables on irregular geometries using PointNet integrated with flow matching and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that use pixelation to project geometries onto uniform lattices or require auxiliary networks for geometry conditioning, and to avoid high-frequency noise artifacts present in graph neural network-based diffusion models.

Method: Incorporates PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models to operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains. Uses reverse generative process to reconstruct physical fields from Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries.

Result: Achieves more accurate predictions of velocity/pressure fields and lift/drag forces compared to vanilla PointNet. Exhibits greater robustness to incomplete geometries and avoids high-frequency noise artifacts.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks provide simple, unified architectures that effectively handle irregular geometries for fluid flow prediction, outperforming baseline methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.

*Han Zhang,Yanwei Wang,Fang Li,Hongjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFRCP is a plug-in module for YOLOv11 that improves object detection in motion-blurred images by adaptively injecting fuzzy features through dynamic robust switches, achieving 10.4% higher accuracy with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake degrades object detection performance, but existing solutions either lose important structural information or add too much latency for edge deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: DFRCP enhances YOLOv11's feature pyramid by combining multi-scale features and introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multi-scale features, then merged through transparency convolution. A custom CUDA kernel accelerates rotation/interpolation by 400x.

Result: On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4% higher accuracy than baseline YOLOv11 with only modest training time overhead. The method reduces need for manual filtering after data collection.

Conclusion: DFRCP provides an effective plug-in solution for blur-robust object detection that balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for edge deployment while reducing post-collection data processing needs.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.

*Siyi Lyu,Quan Liu,Feng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs fail at spatial reasoning due to architectural complexity limits - they can't efficiently learn non-solvable group structures like 3D rotations, creating a fundamental complexity gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers perform well on semantic tasks but systematically fail at spatial reasoning like mental rotation. The paper investigates whether this is due to data limitations or intrinsic architectural constraints.

Method: Formalize spatial understanding as learning group homomorphisms that preserve algebraic structure. Analyze computational complexity: show that for non-solvable groups (SO(3)), structure-preserving embeddings are NC¹-complete, while constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are bounded by TC⁰.

Result: Under the TC⁰ ⊊ NC¹ conjecture, constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. Latent-space probing validates this complexity gap, showing ViT representations suffer structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as depth increases.

Conclusion: ViTs' spatial reasoning failures stem from intrinsic architectural complexity limitations, not just data scale. The TC⁰ vs NC¹ complexity boundary explains why they can't efficiently learn non-solvable group structures like 3D rotations.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IBISAgent is a novel agentic MLLM that reformulates medical image segmentation as a multi-step decision-making process using visual reasoning and text-based click actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without architectural modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLM segmentation approaches have limitations: they introduce implicit segmentation tokens requiring simultaneous fine-tuning (risking catastrophic forgetting and poor generalization), and rely on single-pass reasoning without iterative refinement capabilities.

Method: IBISAgent treats segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process where MLLMs generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions to invoke segmentation tools. It uses a two-stage training framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source state-of-the-art methods in medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: IBISAgent successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling iterative refinement through multi-step visual reasoning without architectural changes, promoting pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities in medical MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.

TL;DR: CFSG model disentangles concept and feature spaces into common, specific, and confounding components with adaptive mechanisms for fine-grained domain generalization, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained domain generalization is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and pronounced intra-class variations. Current models become overly sensitive to fine-grained cues under domain shifts, suppressing critical features. Humans use both common and specific attributes for classification, but deep learning models haven't effectively incorporated this mechanism.

Method: Proposes Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG) that explicitly disentangles concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. Includes adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust component proportions based on distribution shifts, and assigns explicit weights to each component pair in final prediction.

Result: Achieves average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by average of 3.08% on three single-source benchmark datasets. Explainability analysis validates effective integration of multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms feature structuralization facilitates concept structuralization emergence.

Conclusion: CFSG successfully addresses fine-grained domain generalization challenges by incorporating human-like cognitive mechanisms of using both common and specific attributes, with structured disentanglement and adaptive component adjustment leading to significant performance gains.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.

*Chenchen Lin,Sanbao Su,Rachel Luo,Yuxiao Chen,Yan Wang,Marco Pavone,Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGIF introduces a lightweight, query-dependent fusion module that dynamically combines features from multiple vision encoder layers to reduce hallucinations and improve visual grounding in multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs underutilize the rich hierarchy of visual features in vision encoders by relying only on single late-layer features, leading to visually ungrounded hallucinations and over-reliance on language priors rather than image evidence.

Method: TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion) treats vision encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. It follows direct external fusion principles, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead.

Result: Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Conclusion: Query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective approach to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs, demonstrating the value of dynamically leveraging multi-layer visual features.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework with Xception model, adversarial training, and Grad-CAM visualization effectively detects grape leaf diseases with high accuracy and interpretability, supporting practical agricultural applications.

Abstract: Plant disease diagnosis is essential to farmers' management choices because plant diseases frequently lower crop yield and product quality. For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception. Xception shows a promising result of 96.23% accuracy, which is remarkable than InceptionV3. Adversarial Training is used for robustness, along with more transparency. Grad-CAM is integrated to confirm the leaf disease. Finally deployed a web application using Streamlit with a heatmap visualization and prediction with confidence level for robust grape leaf disease classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Thinker is a reasoning architecture that separates thinking from generation to improve logic-intensive image synthesis, using structured planning and reinforcement learning to bridge the reasoning-execution gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, showing a persistent reasoning-execution gap. Closed-source systems demonstrate strong reasoning-driven image generation, creating a substantial gap with open-source models that requires executable reasoning rather than just better visual generators.

Method: Proposes Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture with a dedicated Thinker decoupled from the Generator. Uses a two-stage training: first builds a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then applies reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, optimizing visual correctness over textual plausibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

Conclusion: Closing the reasoning-execution gap requires executable reasoning that decomposes high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans, which Unified Thinker achieves through its modular reasoning architecture and reinforcement learning approach.

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

Result: Achieves strong generalization across tissues on PanNuke and MoNuSeg datasets, with state-of-the-art efficiency - over 5x faster than the next-fastest leading method.

Conclusion: LSP-DETR provides a precise, scalable, and efficient end-to-end solution for nuclei instance segmentation in computational pathology, eliminating the need for patch-based processing and manual post-processing.

Abstract: Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have computational overhead from multi-step inference that hinders real-world deployment, and there's a challenge in combining multiple acceleration techniques effectively.

Method: Two main components: 1) DiffBench - comprehensive benchmark with 3-stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures and deployment scenarios; 2) DiffAgent - LLM agent with closed-loop workflow including planning, code generation, debugging components, and genetic algorithm for performance feedback.

Result: DiffBench provides thorough evaluation of generated acceleration codes, and DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of automating diffusion model acceleration through LLM-driven code generation and systematic evaluation, enabling more efficient deployment of diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal medical LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding in chest X-rays, lacking true anatomical correspondence despite grounding techniques.

Method: Two-stage approach inspired by radiological workflow: first identifies anatomical structures and extracts features, then uses LLM for downstream tasks like phrase grounding, report generation, VQA, and image understanding.

Result: Achieves superior anatomical reasoning with over 25% improvement in anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis, and grounded captioning tasks across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: AnatomiX effectively addresses anatomical understanding gaps in medical LLMs through explicit anatomical grounding, significantly improving chest X-ray interpretation performance.

Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCorn is a self-improvement framework that addresses the "Conduction Aphasia" problem in Unified Multimodal Models - where models understand multimodal inputs but struggle to generate faithful outputs. It uses self-play with three internal roles to enhance image generation without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) show strong cross-modal comprehension but have a significant gap in leveraging this knowledge for high-quality generation. This discrepancy is formalized as "Conduction Aphasia" - models can interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis.

Method: UniCorn partitions a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge. Through self-play, it generates high-quality interactions and uses cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. The framework requires no external data or teacher supervision.

Result: UniCorn achieves comprehensive improvements over base models across six general image generation benchmarks, achieving SOTA on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle. It delivers substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG, while maintaining robust comprehension capabilities.

Conclusion: The method significantly enhances text-to-image generation while maintaining comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence. UniCorn effectively addresses the Conduction Aphasia problem through internal self-improvement.

Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models generate silent videos, missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides, creating an incomplete audiovisual experience.

Method: Uses an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with 14B-parameter video stream and 5B-parameter audio stream, connected via bidirectional audio-video cross-attention with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN. Includes multilingual text encoder and modality-aware classifier-free guidance for improved alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, comparable to proprietary models but with significantly lower computational cost and inference time. Generates rich, coherent audio tracks with natural background and foley elements.

Conclusion: LTX-2 demonstrates that unified audiovisual generation is feasible with efficient architecture design, providing high-quality synchronized content while being computationally efficient and fully open-source.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.

*Daoan Zhang,Wenlin Yao,Xiaoyang Wang,Yebowen Hu,Jiebo Luo,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A MultiMedia-Agent system is proposed to automate complex content creation by integrating multiple AI tools through agent-based orchestration, addressing the limitations of current AIGC models that can't handle end-to-end multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC models are limited to individual components in specific scenarios and cannot handle end-to-end complex content creation tasks that require multimodal integration (video, audio, text). Real-world applications need systems that can orchestrate multiple tools to create integrated multimedia content.

Method: The system includes: 1) A data generation pipeline and tool library for content creation, 2) Skill acquisition theory for training data curation and agent training, 3) Two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization (self-correlation and model preference correlation), 4) Three-stage training approach (base/success plan finetuning and preference optimization).

Result: The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

Conclusion: The MultiMedia-Agent system successfully addresses the limitations of current AIGC models by providing an agent-based solution for automated complex content creation with multimodal integration capabilities.

Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Muses is a training-free method for generating 3D creatures using skeletal guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results without optimization or manual assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for 3D creature generation suffer from unrealistic or incoherent results due to challenges with part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation capabilities.

Method: Uses 3D skeletons as fundamental representation, with a three-stage pipeline: 1) Graph-constrained reasoning for creative skeleton composition, 2) Voxel-based assembly in structured latent space guided by skeleton, 3) Image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and text alignment, with potential for flexible 3D object editing.

Conclusion: Muses demonstrates that skeletal guidance enables effective training-free 3D creature generation with coherent structure and harmonious appearance.

Abstract: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

TL;DR: Proposes EGxFSL and xGAL frameworks combining few-shot learning with explainability guidance using radiologist-defined regions and attention misalignment for medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two key challenges in medical image analysis: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning addresses data limitations but lacks transparency, while active learning overlooks interpretability of acquired samples.

Method: EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 92% (BraTS MRI), 76% (VinDr-CXR), and 62% (SIIM-COVID-19), consistently outperforming non-guided baselines. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieved 76% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations show models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with cross-modality validation on breast ultrasound.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-framework solution effectively addresses both data scarcity and interpretability challenges in medical image analysis, demonstrating superior performance and clinical relevance through explainability-guided approaches that synergistically combine few-shot learning and active learning.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\%, 76\%, and 62\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.
