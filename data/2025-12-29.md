Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven framework using Vision-Language Models to extract audiovisual features and predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos, outperforming traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation frameworks like VideoScore-2 focus on visual/semantic fidelity but fail to capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement, especially for short-form content.

Method: Uses VLMs to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on a curated YouTube Shorts dataset.

Result: Strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that the lightweight feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (SSIM, FID).

Conclusion: The approach advances robust and explainable video understanding by grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals.

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBF is a tool-use framework for medical imaging that uses a learned Tool Bottleneck Model to compose specialized tools selected by a VLM, outperforming text-based composition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based tool composition methods perform poorly on medical images where spatially-localized features are difficult to compose via text alone, requiring better fusion of clinically-relevant features.

Method: Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF) uses a VLM to select specialized tools from a toolbox, then composes them via a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM) neural network that fuses tool outputs for final prediction.

Result: TBF performs on par or better than deep learning classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, especially in data-limited regimes, with gains in histopathology and dermatology tasks.

Conclusion: The framework improves medical image understanding by enabling better tool composition through learned neural fusion, yielding more interpretable and clinically-grounded predictors.

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

*Nairouz Mrabah,Mohamed Bouguessa,Sihem Sami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDSNet is a scalable deep subspace clustering framework that reduces computational complexity from O(n³) to O(n) using landmark-based approximation and avoids full affinity matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subspace clustering methods face scalability limits due to O(n³) computational cost from constructing full affinity matrices and spectral decomposition. Deep learning approaches improve feature extraction but maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations.

Method: SDSNet uses: (1) landmark-based approximation to avoid full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. Combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints.

Result: SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency, demonstrating O(n) complexity instead of traditional O(n³).

Conclusion: The proposed SDSNet framework provides an efficient solution to the scalability problem in subspace clustering while maintaining competitive clustering performance through landmark-based approximation and joint optimization techniques.

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GPR image interpretation is subjective and inefficient, requiring expert knowledge. There's a need for automated, objective defect detection in subsurface road evaluation to overcome data scarcity and complex background challenges.

Method: Three-part framework: 1) DCGAN-based data augmentation for synthetic GPR images, 2) MCGA-Net architecture with Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for multi-scale representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context awareness, 3) MS COCO transfer learning for backbone network fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy, overcoming data scarcity and subjective interpretation limitations.

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.

### [5] [CCAD: Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21459)
*Xiao Jin,Liang Diao,Qixin Xiao,Yifan Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yuchen Liu,Haisong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCAD combines reconstruction-based and representation-based anomaly detection by using compressed global features as a condition for reconstruction, improving performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods face challenges: unsupervised representation methods struggle with domain shift, while reconstruction methods have low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. There's a need to combine strengths of both approaches.

Method: CCAD synergizes both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for reconstruction models. It includes an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance generalization and training efficiency.

Result: CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in AUC while achieving faster convergence. The authors also contribute a reorganized/re-annotated DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations.

Conclusion: CCAD effectively addresses limitations of existing anomaly detection methods by combining reconstruction and representation approaches, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency across experiments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

### [6] [IMA++: ISIC Archive Multi-Annotator Dermoscopic Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21472)
*Kumar Abhishek,Jeremy Kawahara,Ghassan Hamarneh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISIC MultiAnnot++ is the largest publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset with 17,684 masks across 14,967 dermoscopic images, including annotator metadata for research on segmentation variability and preference modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation research lacks large-scale public datasets, especially for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging where morphological structures are critical but expensive to annotate.

Method: Created ISIC MultiAnnot++ by collecting and organizing segmentation masks from the ISIC Archive, including 2,394 images with 2-5 segmentations per image, and adding metadata about annotators' skill levels and segmentation tools.

Result: The dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, making it the largest publicly available skin lesion segmentation dataset with multi-annotator labels and comprehensive metadata.

Conclusion: ISIC MultiAnnot++ enables research on annotator-specific preference modeling, segmentation variability analysis, and other topics requiring multi-annotator medical image segmentation data, addressing a critical gap in dermatological AI research.

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

### [7] [GPF-Net: Gated Progressive Fusion Learning for Polyp Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21476)
*Suncheng Xiang,Xiaoyang Wang,Junjie Jiang,Hejia Wang,Dahong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Gated Progressive Fusion network for colonoscopic polyp re-identification, using multi-level feature fusion with gating mechanisms to improve matching accuracy for small polyps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colonoscopic polyp re-identification is crucial for colorectal cancer prevention but faces challenges with small polyps where coarse high-level features lead to inferior results due to loss of detailed information.

Method: Introduces Gated Progressive Fusion network that selectively fuses features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way, with gated progressive fusion strategy for layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show benefits of multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the challenge of matching small polyps by preserving detailed information through selective multi-level feature fusion, improving polyp re-identification performance for colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

### [8] [Generative Multi-Focus Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21495)
*Xinzhe Xie,Buyu Guo,Bolin Li,Shuangyan He,Yanzhen Gu,Qingyan Jiang,Peiliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFF is a two-stage generative multi-focus image fusion framework that first performs deterministic fusion using StackMFF V4, then uses IFControlNet (latent diffusion model) for generative restoration to handle missing focal planes and eliminate edge artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-focus image fusion methods assume at least one input image has each spatial location in focus, and suffer from edge artifacts due to uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Deterministic fusion using StackMFF V4 with focal plane information, 2) Generative restoration using IFControlNet (latent diffusion model) to reconstruct missing content, restore details, and eliminate artifacts.

Result: GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance, handles complex multi-focal content effectively, and shows significant potential for practical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed GMFF framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by combining deterministic fusion with generative restoration, offering robust performance for multi-focus image fusion in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

### [9] [SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507)
*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers introduce the first benchmark for evaluating social reasoning in video generation, revealing that current models excel at visual realism but fail at understanding social behavior and psychological logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models produce visually realistic videos but lack the ability to generate socially coherent behavior that reflects human understanding of intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms.

Method: Created a benchmark based on 30 classic social cognition paradigms organized into 7 core dimensions. Developed a training-free agent-based pipeline that distills reasoning mechanisms, synthesizes scenarios, enforces conceptual neutrality, and evaluates videos using a VLM judge across 5 social reasoning dimensions.

Result: Large-scale evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art video generation systems shows substantial performance gaps: models excel in surface-level plausibility but systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between current video generation capabilities and human-like social reasoning, highlighting the need for models that can understand and generate socially coherent behavior beyond visual realism.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

### [10] [Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508)
*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient training methods (frozen encoders, adapters, LoRA) achieve better chest X-ray classification performance than full fine-tuning with 40x fewer parameters, though they have calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal chest X-ray analysis typically requires computationally expensive fine-tuning of large vision-language models. The paper aims to study parameter-efficient training strategies to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Evaluated various parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters on multi-label chest X-ray classification. Used Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs) with pathology terms redacted from reports to prevent data leakage. Conducted external validation on CheXpert dataset (224,316 images). Compared vision-only vs multimodal models under fixed parameter budgets.

Result: All PET methods achieved AUROC between 0.892-0.908 with only 2.37M parameters (2.51% of total), outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC) with 94.3M parameters (40x reduction). External validation on CheXpert showed adapters performed best (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons revealed vision-only models (0.653 AUROC) outperformed multimodal models (0.641 AUROC), suggesting improvements come from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. PET methods showed degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049).

Conclusion: Frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost compared to full fine-tuning. However, they suffer from calibration issues that need post-hoc correction for clinical deployment. The performance improvements appear to stem from efficient parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy.

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

### [11] [Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512)
*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol for AI-generated image detectors to address misleading robustness estimates, revealing that ViTs maintain performance under compression while CNNs collapse, and semantic patterns provide more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods produce misleading robustness estimates by retuning thresholds per condition, artificially inflating performance and masking deployment failures. There's a need for deployment-relevant evaluation that maintains fixed decision thresholds across post-processing transformations.

Method: Introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds (selected once on clean validation data) fixed across all post-processing transformations. Uses a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid architecture with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Evaluates at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing.

Result: Reveals a forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos (93.33%) but collapse under compression (61.49%), while ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%). All architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) vs photorealistic images (0.747-0.759). Hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% on photos, 89.7% on art/graphics, 98.3% on CIFAKE.

Conclusion: Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation and reveals genuine robustness gaps. Provides actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening. Semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts.

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

### [12] [MuS-Polar3D: A Benchmark Dataset for Computational Polarimetric 3D Imaging under Multi-Scattering Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21513)
*Puyun Wang,Kaimin Yu,Huayang He,Xianyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuS-Polar3D is the first public benchmark dataset for polarization-based underwater 3D imaging, featuring 42 objects captured under controlled scattering conditions with ground truth 3D models, enabling fair evaluation of reconstruction algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polarization-based underwater 3D imaging datasets lack diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons between different methods (single-view vs multi-view).

Method: Constructed MuS-Polar3D dataset with 42 objects captured under 7 controlled scattering conditions and 5 viewpoints, providing high-precision 3D models, normal maps, and masks. Proposed a two-stage pipeline: descattering followed by 3D reconstruction from imaging-chain perspective.

Result: Extensive evaluations show best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. Dataset supports multiple vision tasks including normal estimation, segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction under complex scattering conditions.

Conclusion: MuS-Polar3D enables accurate 3D reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions, addressing the lack of diverse public datasets for polarization-based underwater 3D imaging.

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

### [13] [DiverseGRPO: Mitigating Mode Collapse in Image Generation via Diversity-Aware GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21514)
*Henglin Liu,Huijuan Huang,Jing Wang,Chang Liu,Xiu Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel GRPO method with distributional creativity bonus and structure-aware regularization to address diversity degradation in RL-based image generation, achieving 13-18% diversity improvement while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GRPO methods suffer from homogenized outputs and lack of creativity in later training stages due to single-sample reward signals and misaligned regularization that neglects early-stage denoising's role in preserving diversity.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Distributional creativity bonus using spectral clustering over semantically grouped samples to allocate exploratory rewards based on group sizes; 2) Structure-aware regularization enforcing stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization.

Result: Achieves 13-18% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses diversity degradation in RL-based image generation by simultaneously improving reward modeling and generation dynamics, enabling better quality-diversity trade-offs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

*Jiayu Li,Rajesh Gangireddy,Samet Akcay,Wei Cheng,Juhua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language Models that enforces structural consistency in hierarchical classification with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM adaptation to hierarchical classification treats labels as flat categories, requires expensive full fine-tuning, and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels.

Method: Proposes two hierarchy-aware objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) for vertical coherence along ground-truth label paths, and Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) for consistency among sibling classes. Both work in VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies while maintaining hierarchical consistency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

*Dongchen Han,Tianyu Li,Ziyi Wang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Circulant Attention replaces standard self-attention with Block Circulant matrices to achieve O(N log N) complexity while maintaining model capacity, addressing quadratic complexity issues in vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention's quadratic complexity creates heavy computational burden in high-resolution vision scenarios, limiting practical applications. Previous methods using handcrafted patterns like locality or sparsity compromise model capacity.

Method: Identifies that self-attention matrices in vision Transformers approximate Block Circulant matrices with Circulant Blocks (BCCB). Models attention maps as nearest BCCB matrices and develops efficient O(N log N) computation algorithm using circulant matrix properties.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate effectiveness. The approach achieves near-linear O(N log N) complexity while largely maintaining standard self-attention capacity, making it practical for high-resolution applications.

Conclusion: Circulant Attention provides an efficient alternative to self-attention for vision Transformers, balancing computational efficiency with model capacity preservation through structured matrix approximation.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

*Sanghyun Jo,Donghwan Lee,Eunji Jung,Seong Je Oh,Kyungsu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EraseLoRA: A dataset-free object removal framework using background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation to prevent target reappearance and reconstruct occluded background with structural fidelity, outperforming attention-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object removal requires preventing masked targets from reappearing and reconstructing occluded background with structural/contextual fidelity, not just plausible hole filling. Current dataset-free approaches using attention redirection fail by misinterpreting non-target foregrounds as background (regenerating unwanted objects) and disrupting fine details through direct attention manipulation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE) uses multimodal LLMs to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from single image-mask pair without supervision, producing reliable background cues. 2) Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA) performs test-time optimization treating inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces, enforcing consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives without explicit attention intervention.

Result: Validated as plug-in to pretrained diffusion models across object removal benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods.

Conclusion: EraseLoRA effectively addresses limitations of attention-based approaches by replacing attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation, achieving reliable object removal without paired supervision while preserving local detail and global structure.

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two new tasks for advertising/digital media: context-aware object insertion (predicting suitable objects, generating them, placing plausibly) and sponsor-product logo augmentation (detecting products, inserting correct brand logos). Two new datasets built to support these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing approaches using vision-language models and diffusion models rarely ensure that inserted objects are contextually appropriate. There's a need for more intelligent editing that considers contextual relevance, especially for advertising and digital media applications.

Method: Introduces two new tasks and builds two corresponding datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels to support research in these areas.

Result: Two new tasks defined (context-aware object insertion and sponsor-product logo augmentation) and two new datasets created with comprehensive annotations to enable future research.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the gap in contextual appropriateness in image editing by proposing novel tasks and providing datasets to advance research in intelligent image editing for advertising and digital media applications.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

TL;DR: Analysis of reproducibility and generalizability issues in AIGC image detection, identifying root causes through review of 7 key papers and experimental reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC detection technologies face two core problems: poor reproducibility and insufficient generalizability, which hinder practical application despite rapid advancement.

Method: Reviewed 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructed a lightweight test dataset, and reproduced a representative detection method to analyze reproducibility issues.

Result: Basic performance can be reproduced when strictly following core procedures, but detection performance drops sharply when preprocessing disrupts key features or when testing across different generators.

Conclusion: Identifies root causes: papers omit implicit details (preprocessing, parameters) and methods overfit to exclusive generator features rather than learning universal AIGC features. Provides empirical evidence for improving reproducibility and reference directions for better experimental disclosure and generalizability verification.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

*Haoyi Zhou,Shuo Li,Tianyu Chen,Qi Song,Chonghan Gao,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAid: A knowledge distillation method that transfers long-range attention mechanisms from large to small vision-language models, enabling 3.2x longer effective context windows while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small vision-language models have limited window sizes that fail at linguistics-photography alignment, and conventional methods don't effectively transfer long-range attention capabilities from large models to smaller ones.

Method: LAid uses two complementary components: 1) progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and 2) learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed.

Result: LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis shows LAid preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer.

Conclusion: LAid provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs and offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation, addressing the limitation of small models' window sizes.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

TL;DR: Pearl is an LLM-free supervised metric for image caption evaluation that works in both reference-based and reference-free settings, outperforming existing LLM-free metrics on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based metrics show bias by favoring their own generations, while most LLM-free metrics lack high performance despite being neutral. There's a need for a metric that combines neutrality with strong performance.

Method: Proposes Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric that learns representations of image-caption and caption-caption similarities. Also constructs a large human-annotated dataset with ~333k judgments from 2,360 annotators across 75k+ images.

Result: Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: Pearl provides an effective LLM-free solution for image caption evaluation that addresses both neutrality concerns and performance limitations of existing approaches, with demonstrated superiority across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: UltraLBM-UNet demonstrates suitability for point-of-care deployment in dermatology, providing accurate and robust lesion analysis with minimal computational resources, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

TL;DR: ALARM is a label-free harmful meme detection framework using Large Multimodal Model agent self-improvement that identifies explicit memes to iteratively enhance detection of complex harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful memes pose public health risks, but existing methods require extensive labeled data which is costly to obtain and cannot adapt to evolving harmful content online.

Method: Uses Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification to isolate explicit memes with pseudo-labels, then Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement reorganizes them into contrastive pairs to refine an LMM agent that learns high-level detection cues.

Result: Superior performance on three diverse datasets, strong adaptability to newly evolved memes, and even outperforms label-driven methods.

Conclusion: ALARM demonstrates label-free frameworks as scalable, promising solutions for adapting to novel harmful meme forms in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

Conclusion: GaussianEM successfully addresses the challenge of analyzing cryo-EM datasets with mixed continuous and discrete motions, offering an interpretable framework for studying protein dynamics and conformational heterogeneity.

Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging.

GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCMP introduces the first long-context MLLM personalization benchmark to evaluate personalized concept variations in extended dialogues, with TAME as a training-free baseline using double memories and RA2G for context-aware responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM personalization methods focus only on simple visual identification and textual replacement, lacking support for long-context conversations where personalized concepts evolve over time. There's a need for benchmarks that assess MLLMs' ability to handle temporal variations in personalized concepts during extended dialogues.

Method: Proposes LCMP benchmark for evaluating long-context MLLM personalization, and introduces TAME framework with double memories (temporal and persistent) to manage concept variations, plus RA2G (Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation) for extracting contextually fitted information from retrieved knowledge.

Result: TAME achieves best performance on LCMP benchmark, demonstrating remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios, showing effectiveness in handling personalized concept variations over extended dialogues.

Conclusion: LCMP addresses the gap in long-context MLLM personalization evaluation, and TAME provides an effective training-free solution for managing personalized concept variations, enabling more sophisticated and context-aware personalized assistants.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

TL;DR: CausalFSFG: A causal inference approach for few-shot fine-grained visual categorization that addresses biased data distributions and spurious correlations through sample-level and feature-level interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-FGVC methods overlook that support samples act as confounding variables, introducing biased data distributions and misleading discriminative feature extraction, which hampers performance.

Method: Proposes CausalFSFG with two components: 1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) for sample-level interventions, and 2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) for feature-level interventions, both based on structural causal modeling to eliminate spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars datasets through extensive experiments and analyses.

Conclusion: CausalFSFG effectively addresses biased distributions in FS-FGVC by revealing real causalities from inputs to subcategories through causal intervention, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Existing methods for 3D autonomous driving simulation struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. They often fail in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation, creating a need for a unified solution.

Method: SymDrive introduces a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm that constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation, and uses auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. It also employs a training-free harmonization mechanism that treats vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting for seamless lighting and shadow consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SymDrive provides a unified diffusion-based framework that successfully addresses the challenges of achieving both high-fidelity rendering and controllable scene editing in autonomous driving simulation, offering a solution to long-tail data scarcity problems.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the PPE framework for text-driven image manipulation, identifies limitations in its regularization strategy that causes semantic leakage, and proposes L1 regularization to enforce sparser, more focused latent space edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement where modifying one attribute unintentionally changes other semantic properties like identity or appearance. The PPE framework addresses this but has limitations in its regularization approach.

Method: Analyzes the PPE framework's architecture (BERT-based attribute prediction, StyleGAN2-based generation on CelebA-HQ), identifies dense latent updates causing semantic leakage, and introduces sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed L1 regularization approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: The sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization improves the PPE framework by enabling more disentangled and precise text-driven image editing with reduced semantic leakage.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

*Jiahong Yu,Ziqi Wang,Hailiang Zhao,Wei Zhai,Xueqiang Yan,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackTeller is a temporal multimodal framework for 3D object grounding in driving scenes that uses LiDAR-image fusion and temporal reasoning to understand language references involving motion and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world referring expressions in driving scenes describe objects through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. Current methods lack temporal reasoning capabilities needed for understanding these dynamic references.

Method: TrackTeller integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. It constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics.

Result: On the NuPrompt benchmark, TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, achieving 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Temporal reasoning is crucial for understanding natural language references in dynamic 3D scenes, and TrackTeller's unified multimodal approach effectively addresses the challenge of grounding language expressions that involve motion and interactions.

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models achieve high accuracy but operate as "black boxes" with opaque decision processes, making it difficult to understand which forensic artifacts they rely on and limiting interpretability and robustness.

Method: Combines sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how model features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations, examining geometric properties like intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity.

Result: Found that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that geometric properties of the model's feature manifold vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts, revealing which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts.

Conclusion: The framework provides a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, enabling identification of feature-artifact correspondences and guiding development of more interpretable and robust deepfake detection models.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-Graph: A contrastive graph modeling framework for cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation that leverages structural consistency as domain-transferable prior, outperforming existing methods while preserving source-domain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation methods filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, but this limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. There's a need for a method that can effectively transfer knowledge across domains while maintaining performance on both source and target domains.

Method: Proposes Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph) framework that represents image features as graphs (pixels as nodes, semantic affinities as edges). Includes: 1) Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies with global structure modeling, 2) Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction, and 3) Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity through contrastive learning.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

Conclusion: The proposed C-Graph framework successfully leverages structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior, addressing limitations of existing methods by maintaining both cross-domain performance and source-domain accuracy through graph-based modeling and contrastive learning techniques.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

TL;DR: SlideChain is a blockchain-based framework for verifying semantic extraction from educational slides using VLMs, addressing reproducibility and auditability issues in AI-generated instructional content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are increasingly used for educational content but lack verifiable, reproducible, and auditable semantic outputs, especially in high-stakes STEM domains where inconsistencies across models and environments undermine reliability.

Method: Developed SlideChain framework that extracts concepts and relational triples from medical imaging lecture slides using four state-of-the-art VLMs, creates structured provenance records, and anchors cryptographic hashes on a local EVM-compatible blockchain for tamper-evident auditability.

Result: Analysis revealed significant cross-model discrepancies (low concept overlap, near-zero agreement in relational triples), while SlideChain demonstrated perfect tamper detection, deterministic reproducibility, and practical scalability with evaluated gas usage and throughput.

Conclusion: SlideChain provides a practical, scalable solution for trustworthy multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity in AI-assisted instructional systems.

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT's global self-attention collapses with long sequences; analysis shows it's a degenerate diffusion process converging to Dirac measure at O(1/L) rate, explaining observed rank collapse and token-merging remedy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) suffers from drastic collapse phenomenon when processing long sequences (hundreds of frames), where attention matrices become near rank-one and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.

Method: Mathematical analysis viewing global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process, proving token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at O(1/L) rate, deriving closed-form mean-field partial differential equation to predict rank profile.

Result: Theory quantitatively matches observed attention-heat-map evolution and experimental outcomes, explains why token-merging remedy works by slowing effective diffusion coefficient and delaying collapse without additional training.

Conclusion: The analysis provides principled lens for interpreting scalable 3D-vision transformers, highlights potential for multi-modal generalization, and explains fundamental limitations of global self-attention in long-sequence processing.

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

It learns an approximation of outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that ShinyNeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in digitizing anisotropic specular reflections while also providing plausible physical interpretations and enabling material property editing compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ShinyNeRF successfully addresses the limitation of existing NeRF methods in handling anisotropic specular surfaces, advancing 3D digitization technology for cultural heritage preservation with both improved accuracy and practical editing capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism.

Method: Hybrid dual-path architecture integrating generative prior pathway (variational autoencoder for multi-scale anatomical priors) with segmentation backbone (densely connected blocks + spatial pyramid pooling). Novel triple-attention mechanism guided by anatomical priors dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages.

Result: Achieved excellent performance on RETOUCH benchmark across three OCT devices: mean Dice scores of 93.93% (Cirrus), 95.18% (Spectralis), and 93.47% (Topcon). Maintained low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs.

Conclusion: Prior-AttUNet demonstrates potential as a reliable, efficient tool for automated clinical analysis of macular edema segmentation with strong cross-device generalization capability.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.

Conclusion: This work contributes to advancing Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area, addressing the gap in resources for this widely spoken language.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI models has created an urgent need for reliable detection methods to identify AI-generated images, as existing approaches often fail to generalize well across different generators and struggle with high-fidelity images.

Method: FUSE extracts spectral features using Fast Fourier Transform and semantic features from CLIP's Vision encoder, fuses them into a joint representation, and trains progressively in two stages to enhance detection capabilities.

Result: FUSE achieves state-of-the-art results on Chameleon benchmark, 91.36% mean accuracy on GenImage, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and 94.96% mean Average Precision. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators.

Conclusion: The integration of spectral and semantic features provides robust generalization across diverse AI image generators, maintaining effectiveness even on high-fidelity images where existing methods often fail.

Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-person motion prediction have two main limitations: 1) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings, and 2) High computational costs from quadratic time complexity of attention mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE) with four distinct spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in different spatial/temporal dependencies. Uses bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in different combinations for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in accuracy on four multi-person benchmark datasets, reduces model parameters by 41.38%, and achieves 3.6x speedup in training.

Conclusion: ST-MoE effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion while significantly improving computational efficiency through Mamba-based experts and mixture-of-experts architecture.

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video prediction faces a fundamental trilemma: high-resolution and perceptual quality come at the cost of real-time speed, which is critical for latency-sensitive applications like autonomous UAV navigation in dense urban environments where safety depends on foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery.

Method: RAPTOR uses a single-pass design with Efficient Video Attention (EVA) that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling by alternating operations along spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes, reducing complexity from O((ST)²) to O(S+T). It employs a patch-free design on dense feature maps and uses a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp details.

Result: RAPTOR achieves >30 FPS on Jetson AGX Orin for 512² video, setting new SOTA on UAVid, KTH, and custom high-resolution datasets in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. It boosts mission success rate in real-world UAV navigation by 18%, enabling safer anticipatory agents.

Conclusion: RAPTOR breaks the long-standing trade-off in video prediction by enabling real-time, high-resolution performance on edge hardware, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents in latency-critical applications like autonomous UAV navigation.

Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.

TL;DR: AstraNav-World: An end-to-end world model that jointly predicts future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework, improving embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments requires accurate foresight of world evolution and action sequences. Current approaches often use decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines that suffer from cumulative errors and lack tight coupling between visual predictions and action planning.

Method: Integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy in a unified probabilistic framework. Uses synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals.

Result: Improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks. Demonstrates exceptional zero-shot capabilities in real-world testing, adapting to unseen scenarios without fine-tuning. Ablations confirm necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training.

Conclusion: AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics rather than overfitting to simulation data. Unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model moves toward reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents for open-ended real-world settings.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

*Steven Xiao,XIndi Zhang,Dechao Meng,Qi Wang,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Knot Forcing is a streaming framework for real-time portrait animation that addresses challenges in diffusion-based and autoregressive models through chunk-wise generation with identity preservation, temporal knot modules for smooth transitions, and a "running ahead" mechanism for long-term coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time portrait animation needs high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control for interactive applications. Diffusion models have quality but aren't causal for streaming, while autoregressive approaches suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities, and degraded long-term consistency.

Method: Three key designs: (1) Chunk-wise generation with global identity preservation via cached KV states of reference images and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) Temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning; (3) "Running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference to keep semantic context ahead of current rollout frame.

Result: Enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences with real-time performance and strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: Knot Forcing successfully addresses streaming challenges for real-time portrait animation, providing a practical solution for applications requiring interactive, coherent, and high-quality animated portraits with low latency.

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

*Xindi Zhang,Dechao Meng,Steven Xiao,Qi Wang,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncAnyone: A two-stage diffusion framework for high-quality video dubbing that achieves accurate lip-sync while preserving facial structure and background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based video dubbing methods disrupt spatiotemporal context, causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. There's a need for a method that achieves both accurate lip synchronization and high visual fidelity.

Method: Two-stage learning framework: Stage 1 trains a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting to generate audio-driven lip movements. Stage 2 uses mask-free tuning with pseudo-paired training samples (synthesized lip-synced videos from source video and random audio) to address mask-induced artifacts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation in in-the-wild lip-syncing scenarios.

Conclusion: SyncAnyone successfully overcomes limitations of mask-based methods by combining accurate motion modeling with high visual fidelity through a novel two-stage approach.

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

TL;DR: A-QCF-Net learns unified segmentation from unpaired CT/MRI using quaternion networks and adaptive cross-fusion for bidirectional knowledge transfer, achieving significant improvements over unimodal baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information for accurate pathology delineation, but deep learning development is limited by scarcity of large, paired, spatially-aligned datasets. The paper addresses this by enabling learning from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that constructs a shared feature space using Quaternion Neural Networks. The core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data-driven attention module enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer between CT and MRI streams, allowing dynamic modulation of information flow to exchange modality-specific expertise.

Result: Jointly trained model on unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, exceeding unimodal nnU-Net baseline by 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Explainability analysis confirms model focuses on relevant pathological structures.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for leveraging large unpaired imaging archives common in healthcare, enabling unified segmentation models to learn from separate modality cohorts without requiring paired data.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

### [46] [BertsWin: Resolving Topological Sparsity in 3D Masked Autoencoders via Component-Balanced Structural Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21769)
*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Studenikina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BertsWin: A hybrid SSL architecture combining BERT-style masking with Swin Transformer windows for 3D medical imaging that achieves 5.8x faster convergence and 15x reduction in training epochs compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE) struggle with 3D volumetric medical images because they discard 75% of tokens during pre-training, making it hard to capture three-dimensional spatial relationships. There's a need for better self-supervised learning methods that can effectively handle 3D spatial context in medical imaging.

Method: Proposes BertsWin - a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows. Unlike classic MAE which processes only visible areas, BertsWin maintains a complete 3D grid of tokens (both masked and visible) to preserve spatial topology. Uses single-level local Swin windows to handle quadratic complexity of ViT. Introduces structural priority loss function and evaluates on cone beam CT of temporomandibular joints.

Result: BertsWin achieves 5.8x faster semantic convergence compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. When combined with GradientConductor optimizer, achieves 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines at canonical input resolutions, resulting in significant computational savings due to faster convergence.

Conclusion: BertsWin effectively addresses the limitations of standard MAE for 3D medical imaging by preserving complete spatial topology while maintaining computational efficiency. The architecture enables faster convergence and reduced training requirements without computational penalties, making it practical for 3D volumetric medical image analysis.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

*Jingbo Yang,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a VAE-GAN hybrid video generator with variational encoder for inference capabilities, extended with Markov chain framework for generating long videos (hundreds/thousands of frames) while maintaining quality and temporal continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Networks) struggle with generating long video sequences - quality degrades when scaling beyond short sequences (typically up to 16 frames). Need for models that can generate meaningful, coherent long videos with temporal continuity.

Method: 1) Proposes VAE-GAN hybrid structure with variational encoder for inference capabilities. 2) Extends this with Markov chain framework where each state represents a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. 3) Uses recall mechanism to sequentially connect generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies and long video generation.

Result: Enables generation of long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames while ensuring temporal continuity, consistency, and dynamics - overcoming the quality degradation problem of classical approaches when scaling video length.

Conclusion: The proposed memory-efficient approach successfully extends video generation capabilities to long sequences by combining VAE-GAN architecture with Markov chain framework and recall mechanism, maintaining video quality and temporal coherence at scale.

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder-based methods for video scene segmentation have limitations: visual-centric biases, isolated shot classification without sequential dependencies, lack of narrative understanding, and poor explainability.

Method: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned VLM framework that processes visual and textual cues (frames, transcriptions, metadata) for multimodal reasoning. It generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies, uses context-focus windows for temporal context, extracts confidence scores from token-level logits, and can generate natural-language rationales with minimal supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over previous leading method.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuned vision-language models for video scene segmentation, overcoming limitations of encoder-based methods through multimodal reasoning, sequential processing, and explainable decision-making.

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructMoLE improves multi-conditional DiT fine-tuning by replacing token-level routing with global instruction-guided routing to prevent spatial fragmentation and semantic drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) suffer from task interference with monolithic adapters like LoRA, while MoLE architectures have limited effectiveness due to token-level routing that conflicts with global user instructions, causing spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation.

Method: Introduces InstructMoLE framework with Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR) that uses global routing signals from user instructions to select a single expert council applied uniformly across all tokens. Also includes an output-space orthogonality loss to promote expert diversity and prevent representational collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments show InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks, achieving superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Conclusion: InstructMoLE presents a robust, generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models that preserves global semantics and structural integrity through global routing and expert diversity promotion.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-quality single-image super-resolution using diffusion posterior sampling without retraining the diffusion model for each degradation operator, by combining unconditional diffusion priors with measurement consistency constraints.

Method: Implements likelihood-guided sampling that combines unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for 4× super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. Evaluates posterior sampling conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels using PSNR, SSIM, and a combined selection score.

Result: Moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with best configuration at PS scale 0.95 and noise standard deviation σ=0.01 (score 1.45231). Selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to downsampled inputs, outperforming alternative conditioning strategies like MCG and PS-annealed.

Conclusion: Balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength is crucial for stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining diffusion models for each operator, with posterior sampling providing optimal trade-offs between texture fidelity and measurement consistency.

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency.

Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Selective adversarial attacks targeting only high-entropy tokens (critical decision points) achieve comparable semantic degradation to global attacks with smaller budgets, while converting 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing significant VLM safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and prior entropy-based attacks assume all tokens contribute equally to generation instability. The authors discovered that only a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens disproportionately govern output trajectories, suggesting more efficient attack strategies.

Method: Proposed Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA) that concentrate adversarial perturbations on critical decision points (high-entropy tokens) rather than all decoding steps. This selective approach targets the positions that most influence output trajectories.

Result: Selective attacks achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods with substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, they convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones across multiple VLMs. The attacks show transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets) and achieve 93-95% attack success rates.

Conclusion: High-entropy tokens represent critical decision points that disproportionately control VLM outputs. By targeting these positions, selective attacks expose significant safety vulnerabilities in current VLMs, revealing weaknesses in safety mechanisms that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCL-PNC is a scalable class-incremental learning method that uses parametric neural collapse to enable demand-driven backbone expansion and dynamic ETF classifiers to handle evolving class distributions while maintaining feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incremental learning methods freeze old model parameters but ignore structural efficiency, leading to feature differences between modules and class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. There's a need for efficient model expansion as categories increase in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes SCL-PNC with: 1) adapt-layer for demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion, 2) dynamic parametric ETF framework that evolves with incremental classes, 3) parallel expansion framework with knowledge distillation to align features across modules and counteract feature drift.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling incremental learning with increasing categories while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: SCL-PNC successfully addresses class misalignment and feature drift in incremental learning through a structured combination of expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and parametric ETF classifier, leveraging neural collapse principles for model convergence.

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T SOD methods rely on manually aligned datasets and fail in real-world scenarios with unaligned image pairs due to spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts.

Method: Uses dual-stream MobileViT encoder with Mamba scanning mechanisms; includes Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to suppress background interference, Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) for spatial alignment, and Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) for inter-modal dependency integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches on various datasets.

Conclusion: TPS-SCL effectively addresses real-world unaligned RGB-T SOD challenges with efficient architecture design and comprehensive alignment/correlation modules.

Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.

*Haodong Lei,Hongsong Wang,Xin Geng,Liang Wang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADT-Tree accelerates autoregressive image generation by dynamically adjusting draft tree structure based on spatial prediction difficulty, achieving 3x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from slow sequential inference (~2000 steps for 576x576 images). Existing speculative decoding methods that work well for LLMs underperform on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty across different image regions.

Method: Proposes Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree) that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. It initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, creating deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones.

Result: Empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate speedups of 3.13x and 3.05x respectively. The method integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods like LANTERN for further acceleration.

Conclusion: ADT-Tree effectively addresses the spatial prediction difficulty problem in visual AR models, enabling significant inference acceleration while maintaining quality, and can be combined with other sampling methods for additional speed improvements.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively.

*Masayuki Kawarada,Kosuke Yamada,Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos,Naoto Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIOR is a training-free method that uses large vision-language models to generate conditional image embeddings by prompting the model to describe images with single words related to specific conditions, then extracting hidden states as embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models like CLIP provide rich image representations but aren't designed to focus on specific conditional aspects (e.g., color, genre) indicated by textual conditions. There's a need for methods that can generate embeddings focused on particular image attributes without requiring additional training.

Method: DIOR prompts a large vision-language model (LVLM) to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition, then extracts the hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token as the conditional image embedding. The approach is training-free and doesn't require task-specific priors.

Result: DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines including CLIP on conditional image similarity tasks. It also achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Conclusion: DIOR provides a versatile, training-free solution for generating conditional image embeddings that can focus on specific aspects of images indicated by textual conditions, demonstrating strong performance without requiring additional training or task-specific priors.

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Feature-level fusion of CNN backbones (EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121) improves binary diabetic retinopathy screening accuracy to 82.89% while maintaining favorable computational efficiency across heterogeneous datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy screening faces challenges due to limited specialist availability and variable image quality across different devices and populations, requiring accurate and efficient automated solutions.

Method: Used 11,156 fundus images from five public datasets, compared three pretrained CNN models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants for binary DR classification across five independent runs.

Result: Fusion consistently outperformed single backbones. EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 fusion achieved best overall mean accuracy (82.89%) with balanced F1-scores (normal: 83.60%, diabetic: 82.60%). EfficientNet-B0 was fastest (1.16 ms/image), while fusion offered best accuracy-latency balance.

Conclusion: Lightweight feature fusion enhances generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

*Yihan Hu,Xuelin Chen,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyOmnimatte: A unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method that finetunes a video inpainting diffusion model with dual complementary experts (Effect Expert and Quality Expert) for high-quality foreground layer decomposition with associated effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video omnimatte methods are slow, multi-stage, or use inference-time optimization pipelines that don't fully exploit generative priors, leading to suboptimal decompositions. The authors recognize that if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove foreground effects, it should also be capable of perceiving and decomposing them.

Method: Finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model with two complementary experts: 1) Effect Expert with LoRA applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture foreground and associated effects, and 2) Quality Expert with full LoRA finetuning to refine alpha mattes. During sampling, Effect Expert handles early high-noise steps while Quality Expert takes over at later low-noise steps.

Result: EasyOmnimatte sets new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency. It enables various downstream tasks and eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, reducing computational cost without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: The proposed Dual-Expert strategy effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging specialized experts for different aspects of the decomposition task, resulting in a unified, end-to-end solution that achieves superior performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPAR introduces a decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into variable-sized patches using next-token prediction entropy, reducing token count by 1.8-2x and FLOPs by up to 40% while improving image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoder-only autoregressive image generation suffers from quadratic token growth with resolution, increasing computational and memory demands. Fixed tokenization schemes are inefficient as they treat all image regions equally regardless of information content.

Method: DPAR uses next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight unsupervised autoregressive model to dynamically merge tokens into larger patches based on information content. It makes minimal modifications to standard decoder architecture and trains with dynamically sized patches to create patch-boundary-robust representations.

Result: DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x (Imagenet 256) and 2.06x (Imagenet 384), reduces training FLOPs by up to 40%, exhibits faster convergence, and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

Conclusion: DPAR demonstrates that dynamic patch aggregation based on information content is an effective approach for efficient decoder-only autoregressive image generation, maintaining compatibility with multimodal frameworks while allocating more compute to high-information regions.

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI foundation models face dual bottlenecks: atlas-based methods lose spatial details and need huge datasets, while atlas-free methods are too memory/compute-intensive for large-scale training.

Method: Two-stage adaptive design: (1) lightweight temporal extractor ranks data windows by saliency, (2) 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns voxel-level representations only from top-k selected windows while masking ~70% patches.

Result: Establishes new SOTA across seven public benchmarks while requiring only 4k pre-training sessions and ~30% GPU memory compared to traditional voxel-level methods.

Conclusion: SLIM-Brain successfully addresses the data- and training-efficiency bottlenecks in fMRI foundation models, enabling effective atlas-free modeling with practical resource requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual localization uses late-fusion pairwise pose regression which is insufficient for spatial integration and degrades in complex environments. Need early-fusion mechanism for better multi-view spatial information integration.

Method: 1) VGGT backbone encodes multi-view 3D geometry; 2) Pose tokenizer and projection module exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views; 3) Sparse mask attention reduces computational cost from quadratic to linear complexity for real-time performance.

Result: Trained on ~8M posed image pairs, demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets validate effectiveness and efficiency, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time with robustness to unseen environments.

Conclusion: First visual localization framework with early-fusion multi-view spatial integration enables robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Code and models will be publicly released.

Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses limitations in long-duration video generation and fine detail synthesis for human animation applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

*Zeyu Liang,Hailun Xia,Naichuan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAN is a human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition that fuses RGB and skeleton data by representing RGB patches containing human joints as spatiotemporal graphs, enabling more effective multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton data suffer from inherent heterogeneity between modalities and fail to fully exploit their complementary potential, limiting action recognition performance.

Method: Proposes PAN framework with human-centric graph modeling: token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. Includes attention-based post calibration to reduce dependency on high-quality skeletal data. Two variants: PAN-Ensemble (dual-path GCNs with late fusion) and PAN-Unified (unified graph representation in single network).

Result: Both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art performance on three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets in their respective settings (separate and unified modeling).

Conclusion: PAN provides an effective human-centric graph representation learning framework that suppresses RGB redundancy, aligns with skeleton methods, and enables semantically coherent multimodal fusion for superior action recognition performance.

Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.

TL;DR: AutoPP is an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates human intervention by combining AI-generated posters with online CTR optimization using feedback data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually creating and optimizing product posters based on online performance is labor-intensive and resource-consuming. There's a need for an automated solution that can generate appealing posters and continuously improve them using real user feedback.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generator uses unified design module to integrate background, text, and layout elements, then element rendering module encodes these into condition tokens for controllable poster generation; 2) Optimizer enhances CTR by systematically replacing elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and uses Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements.

Result: AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings, supported by AutoPP1M dataset containing one million high-quality posters and feedback from over one million users.

Conclusion: AutoPP provides a fully automated solution for product poster generation and optimization that outperforms existing methods, with publicly available code and dataset to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

*Tao Yang,Xiuying Wang,Hao Liu,Guanzhong Gong,Lian-Ming Wu,Yu-Ping Wang,Lisheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework for brain MRI that improves generalizability across multi-modality/multi-center data and reduces abnormal residuals in reconstructed pseudo-healthy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection methods for brain MRI have limited generalizability across different imaging modalities and centers, and suffer from abnormal residuals propagating to reconstructed pseudo-healthy images, constraining performance.

Method: Two novel modules: 1) Disentangled representation module that separates brain MRI into imaging information and anatomical images using brain anatomical priors and differentiable one-hot encoding; 2) Edge-to-image restoration module that reconstructs high-quality pseudo-healthy images from edge information only, reducing abnormal pixel input.

Result: Outperforms 17 state-of-the-art methods on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current unsupervised anomaly detection methods by improving generalizability across imaging conditions and reducing abnormal residuals, leading to superior lesion detection performance in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

*Yiquan Gao,John See*

TL;DR: Proposes Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework for low-light enhancement in anime scenery images, addressing domain gap and data scarcity with uncertainty-aware learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the domain gap in low-light enhancement for anime scenery images, which is underexplored compared to natural images/videos. Aims to solve data scarcity and leverage illumination uncertainty inherent in diverse lighting conditions.

Method: Constructs unpaired anime scenery dataset from various sources. Proposes DRU framework inspired by Relativistic GAN, which defines and quantifies illumination uncertainty (analogous to wave-particle duality of light) to dynamically adjust objective functions and recalibrate model learning under data uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments show DRU framework yields superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond state-of-the-art methods. Framework demonstrates effectiveness when training EnlightenGAN variants, outperforming methods that don't learn from data uncertainty perspective.

Conclusion: DRU framework exposes novel paradigm of data-centric learning for visual and language domains. Successfully bridges domain gap in anime scenery enhancement by leveraging illumination uncertainty, with code made available.

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

### [71] [Automated Discovery of Parsimonious Spectral Indices via Normalized Difference Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21948)
*Ali Lotfi,Adam Carter,Thuan Ha,Mohammad Meysami,Kwabena Nketia,Steve Shirtliffe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method finds compact spectral indices for vegetation classification by generating polynomial combinations of normalized band differences and selecting optimal subsets using feature selection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop automated, interpretable spectral indices for vegetation classification that maintain illumination invariance while being computationally simple enough for deployment in platforms like Google Earth Engine.

Method: Generate all pairwise normalized differences from spectral bands, create polynomial combinations up to degree 2, then apply feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, L1-regularized SVM) to select compact index sets.

Result: Single degree-2 index (product of two red-edge normalized differences) achieved 96.26% accuracy for Kochia detection; 8 indices reached 97.70%. Selected features consistently used bands b4-b8, suggesting spectral interactions are key.

Conclusion: The automated framework successfully finds compact, interpretable spectral indices that maintain high accuracy while being simple enough for practical deployment. The approach is generalizable to other sensors and classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes medical MLLMs' sensitivity to real-world perturbations and proposes a training-free framework (IMC) to enhance cross-modal robustness using inherent denoising capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MLLMs show promising clinical performance but are sensitive to real-world input perturbations like imaging artifacts and textual errors, which undermines clinical applicability. Current robustness studies focus on text modality and require costly fine-tuning, failing to address complex medical noise patterns and safety standards.

Method: Introduces Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework with two components: 1) Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) for visual modality using MLLMs' vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration; 2) Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) for text denoising that exploits MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities through a cooperative hierarchy of agents.

Result: Constructed benchmark with 11 types of noise across image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, demonstrating potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free IMC framework effectively leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities to enhance cross-modal robustness against real-world perturbations, addressing critical safety concerns for clinical deployment of medical MLLMs.

Abstract: Medical Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising clinical performance. However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMSF-A is a lightweight multi-scale attention framework for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, achieving high accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs while maintaining batch-1 stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy is challenging due to narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is constrained by limited surgical hardware, requiring models to balance accuracy and speed while remaining stable under small-batch training.

Method: Proposes LMSF-A with three components: 1) Backbone uses C2f-Pro module combining RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution with efficient multi-scale attention for multi-branch training and single-path inference; 2) Neck employs Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion and Triple Feature Encoding to improve cross-scale consistency and boundary details; 3) Head adopts Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head with shared convolutions and GroupNorm for parameter reduction and batch-1 stability.

Result: LMSF-A achieves competitive or superior performance across all evaluation metrics with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs. It generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark. The authors also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset with 61 patients and 610 images annotated for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve.

Conclusion: LMSF-A provides an effective solution for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, balancing accuracy, speed, and hardware constraints while maintaining stability under small-batch training conditions. The released PELD dataset facilitates further research in this domain.

Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

Motivation: Small task-specific vision models are computationally efficient and explainable, but their explanations often reveal misalignment with human domain knowledge and reliance on spurious correlations, leading to brittle real-world performance.

Method: LVLM-VA (LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment) provides a bidirectional interface: translates model behavior to natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and models via Large Vision Language Models.

Result: Substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications on both synthetic and real-world datasets; effectively reduces model's dependence on spurious features and group-specific biases.

Conclusion: LVLM-VA offers an efficient method to align small vision models with human domain knowledge using LVLMs, improving model robustness and reducing reliance on problematic correlations without requiring fine-grained expert feedback.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

TL;DR: ALEAHallu is an adversarial parametric editing framework that mitigates hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by identifying and fine-tuning hallucination-prone parameter clusters using adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from persistent hallucination issues due to over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration. Existing heuristic decoding calibration strategies are non-trainable, limiting their optimization potential.

Method: Proposes ALEAHallu framework with Activate-Locate-Edit Adversarially paradigm: 1) Construct activation dataset with grounded vs. hallucinatory responses, 2) Identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters via differential hidden state analysis, 3) Fine-tune clusters using adversarial prompts optimized to maximize visual neglect, forcing visual evidence prioritization.

Result: Significant effectiveness demonstrated on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks in alleviating hallucinations.

Conclusion: ALEAHallu provides a trainable parametric editing approach that effectively mitigates VLM hallucinations by forcing models to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with balancing efficiency for routine GUI tasks and precision for fine-grained interactions requiring exact visual grounding. They also remain large and cannot adapt reasoning depth to task complexity.

Method: iSHIFT integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module using special perception tokens. This enables switching between slow mode (detailed visual grounding) and fast mode (global cues) based on task needs.

Result: Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for GUI interaction tasks.

Conclusion: iSHIFT demonstrates that lightweight agents with adaptive reasoning modes and visual attention control can achieve strong performance on complex GUI interaction tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: LongFly is a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for UAV vision-and-language navigation that improves long-horizon navigation by better modeling historical context and trajectory dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV vision-and-language navigation methods struggle with modeling long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex disaster environments, leading to inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning.

Method: Proposes three key modules: 1) slot-based historical image compression to distill multi-view observations into fixed-length contextual representations, 2) spatiotemporal trajectory encoding to capture temporal dynamics and spatial structure, and 3) prompt-guided multimodal integration to combine spatiotemporal context with current observations for time-based reasoning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89% in success rate and 6.33% in success weighted by path length, with consistent performance across both seen and unseen environments.

Conclusion: LongFly effectively addresses the challenges of long-horizon UAV navigation in complex disaster scenarios by transforming fragmented historical data into structured representations and enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning for improved waypoint prediction.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

Motivation: Prompt-driven VSFMs like SAM2 are widely deployed in critical applications (autonomous driving, digital pathology), raising security concerns. Traditional backdoor attacks fail on VSFMs (ASR <5%), creating a need for specialized attacks to understand and address this vulnerability.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Steer image encoder so triggered frames map to target embedding while clean frames align with reference encoder; (2) Train mask decoder so triggered frame-prompt pairs produce shared target mask across prompt types, while clean outputs stay close to reference decoder.

Result: BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Experiments on 2 datasets and 5 VSFMs show effectiveness, with ablations confirming robustness and necessity of two-stage design.

Conclusion: BadVSFM reveals an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs by successfully separating triggered/clean representations and shifting attention to trigger regions. Four representative defenses remain ineffective, highlighting significant security risks in prompt-driven VSFMs.

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

Device-cloud collaboration improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud calls by 40%, and preserves privacy.

Conclusion: MAI-UI successfully addresses key GUI agent deployment challenges through its unified methodology, establishing new SOTA across multiple benchmarks while demonstrating practical deployment advantages through device-cloud collaboration and scalable online RL optimization.

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

TL;DR: Two-stage autoregressive framework adapts diffusion models for real-time interactive avatars with full-body gestures, achieving SOTA quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based avatar methods are non-causal and computationally expensive for streaming, while current interactive approaches are limited to head-and-shoulder regions without full-body gestures.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive adaptation with autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement, featuring Reference Sink, Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR), and Consistency-Aware Discriminator for long-term stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness, capable of generating both talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully enables real-time, interactive human avatars with full-body gestures, overcoming limitations of existing diffusion-based methods for streaming applications.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework called \method generates interactive, continuous worlds from single images or text prompts using diffusion models with real-time performance and text control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based world generation methods have critical limitations: large parameter sizes, slow inference requiring many steps, growing historical context issues, and lack of text control - all preventing real-time performance.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Long-video generation with unified context compression and linear attention, 2) Real-time streaming acceleration via bidirectional attention distillation and enhanced text embedding, 3) Text-controlled world event generation.

Result: The method enables realistic, interactive, continuous world generation from single images or text prompts with keyboard-based exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: \method addresses key limitations of existing diffusion-based world generation approaches by providing real-time performance, text control, and efficient exploration capabilities.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

### [83] [Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105)
*Momir Adžemović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDLP is a tracking-by-detection method that uses link prediction between tracks and detections for per-frame association, learning from data without handcrafted rules while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-object tracking has two main approaches: tracking-by-detection methods that are efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end methods that learn association from data but are computationally complex. There's a need for a method that combines the efficiency of tracking-by-detection with the data-driven learning of end-to-end approaches.

Method: Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP) performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections. It predicts the correct continuation of each track at every frame. The architecture is primarily designed for geometric features like bounding boxes, with optional incorporation of additional cues such as pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic methods, it learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Analysis shows link prediction is more effective than metric learning-based association, especially when handling heterogeneous features like detection bounding boxes.

Conclusion: TDLP successfully bridges the gap between efficient tracking-by-detection methods and data-driven end-to-end approaches by using link prediction for association, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and modularity.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

### [84] [ProEdit: Inversion-based Editing From Prompts Done Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22118)
*Zhi Ouyang,Dian Zheng,Xiao-Ming Wu,Jian-Jian Jiang,Kun-Yu Lin,Jingke Meng,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProEdit improves inversion-based visual editing by addressing source information over-reliance through KV-mix attention mechanism and Latents-Shift perturbation, achieving better editing performance while maintaining background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods overly rely on source image information during sampling, which negatively affects target image edits - often failing to properly change subject attributes like pose, number, or color as instructed.

Method: Two key components: 1) KV-mix - mixes KV features of source and target in edited regions to mitigate source influence while maintaining background consistency; 2) Latents-Shift - perturbs edited region of source latent to eliminate inverted latent influence on sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments on image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods like RF-Solver, FireFlow, and UniEdit.

Conclusion: ProEdit effectively addresses the source information over-reliance problem in inversion-based editing through attention and latent space modifications, achieving superior editing performance while maintaining compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

### [85] [See Less, See Right: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping For Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22120)
*Shuoshuo Zhang,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS) improves vision-language models by using bidirectional where-to-look signals to shape perception during training, addressing issues with existing methods that overlook fine-grained visual evidence, generalize poorly, and have high inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often rely on intermediate visual cues via external tools or latent tokens, but these approaches miss fine-grained visual evidence (like chart polylines), have poor cross-domain generalization, and incur high inference-time costs.

Method: BiPS transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals. It uses two constraints: 1) KL-consistency between original image and evidence-preserving view (keeping only question-relevant regions) for coarse but complete coverage, and 2) KL-separation between original and evidence-ablated view (masking critical pixels) to prevent text-only shortcuts and enforce fine-grained visual reliance.

Result: Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and demonstrates strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

Conclusion: BiPS effectively addresses limitations of existing vision-language models by shaping perception through bidirectional visual evidence constraints, improving both performance and generalization while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.
