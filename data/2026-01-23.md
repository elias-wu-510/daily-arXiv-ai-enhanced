*Christina Thrainer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis proposes three methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes under data scarcity: preprocessing strategies, FORTRESS architecture, and few-shot learning with bidirectional prototypical networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes is crucial for public safety and environmental protection, but data collection and annotation are cumbersome and require domain expertise, making large datasets infeasible.

Method: Three approaches: 1) Preprocessing strategies including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection; 2) FORTRESS architecture combining depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive KAN, and multi-scale attention; 3) Few-shot learning using bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms.

Result: Preprocessing strategies significantly improved IoU and F1 scores; FORTRESS achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing parameters and computational cost; few-shot learning achieved satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully addresses data scarcity in culvert/sewer pipe defect segmentation through three complementary methods that enhance training data, optimize architecture, and enable learning from limited data, demonstrating practical applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Culverts and sewer pipes are critical components of drainage systems, and their failure can lead to serious risks to public safety and the environment. In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.
  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.

*Hatef Otroshi Shahreza,Anjith George,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs perform poorly for heterogeneous face recognition compared to classical systems, especially in challenging cross-spectral conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for biometric applications, specifically heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) where enrollment and probe images come from different sensing modalities.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs across multiple cross-modality scenarios (VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, VIS-THERMAL) using biometric protocols and metrics including Acquire Rate, EER, and TAR.

Result: Substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, despite recent advances in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have significant limitations for HFR applications, highlighting the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation before deployment in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.

### [4] [DuFal: Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning for High-Fidelity Extremely Sparse-view CBCT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15416)
*Cuong Tran Van,Trong-Thang Pham,Ngoc-Son Nguyen,Duy Minh Ho Nguyen,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DuFal is a dual-frequency-aware learning framework for sparse-view CT reconstruction that uses a dual-path architecture with global and local Fourier neural operators to better recover high-frequency anatomical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT reconstruction struggles with recovering fine-grained anatomical details (high-frequency components) because conventional CNN-based methods are biased toward learning low-frequency information, leading to loss of important structural details.

Method: DuFal integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture with: 1) High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator with global and local branches, 2) Spectral-Channel Factorization for efficiency, 3) Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module, and 4) Feature Decoder with Intensity Field Decoding pipeline.

Result: Experimental results on LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets show DuFal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, especially under extremely sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-frequency-aware learning framework effectively addresses the high-frequency recovery challenge in sparse-view CT reconstruction by combining global frequency analysis with local spatial processing, achieving superior performance in preserving anatomical details.

Abstract: Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.

### [5] [DevPrompt: Deviation-Based Prompt Learning for One-Normal ShotImage Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15453)
*Morteza Poudineh,Marc Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deviation-guided prompt learning framework for few-normal shot anomaly detection that combines vision-language models with statistical deviation scoring for better anomaly localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-normal shot anomaly detection methods using vision-language models have weak discriminability between normal/abnormal prompts and lack principled patch-level scoring mechanisms.

Method: Proposes learnable context vectors shared across normal/abnormal prompts with anomaly-specific suffix tokens, plus deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning to model patch features as Gaussian deviations from normal distribution.

Result: Superior pixel-level detection performance on MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks compared to PromptAD and other baselines, with ablation studies validating effectiveness of key components.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates semantic vision-language modeling with statistical deviation scoring, improving anomaly localization and interpretability in few-normal shot settings.

Abstract: Few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD) aims to detect abnormal regions in images using only a few normal training samples, making the task highly challenging due to limited supervision and the diversity of potential defects. Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.

### [6] [Seeing through Light and Darkness: Sensor-Physics Grounded Deblurring HDR NeRF from Single-Exposure Images and Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15475)
*Yunshan Qi,Lin Zhu,Nan Bao,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A NeRF framework that uses sensor-physics modeling to achieve sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis from blurry LDR images with event data ignore sensor-physics mismatches between camera output and real-world radiance, leading to suboptimal HDR and deblurring results.

Method: Proposes a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework that: 1) uses NeRF to represent actual HDR scene radiance, 2) introduces pixel-wise RGB mapping field to align rendered values with sensor-recorded LDR values, 3) designs event mapping field to bridge physical scene dynamics with actual event sensor output, and 4) jointly optimizes both mapping fields with the NeRF network using spatial and temporal event information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results on collected and public datasets using single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.

Conclusion: The sensor-physics grounded approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by modeling the actual physical relationships between scene radiance, sensor output, and event data, enabling superior HDR reconstruction and deblurring for novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from low dynamic range (LDR) blurry images, which are common in the wild, struggles to recover high dynamic range (HDR) and sharp 3D representations in extreme lighting conditions. Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.

### [7] [Hybrid Vision Transformer_GAN Attribute Neutralizer for Mitigating Bias in Chest X_Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15490)
*Jobeal Solomon,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformer neutralizer reduces demographic bias in chest X-ray AI better than convolutional U-Net, cutting sex recognition AUC by ~10 points while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray classifiers often have bias from sex- and age-related shortcuts, causing underdiagnosis of minority groups. Previous convolutional methods reduce but don't fully eliminate attribute leakage at clinically useful edit strengths.

Method: Replace U-Net convolutional encoder with Vision Transformer backbone in Attribute-Neutral Framework. Train DeiT-S neutralizer on ChestX-ray14 dataset, evaluate edited images across 11 edit-intensity levels using independent AI judge for attribute leakage and CNN for disease prediction.

Result: At moderate edit level (alpha=0.5), ViT neutralizer reduces sex-recognition AUC to ~0.80 (10 points below convolutional U-Net), trained for half as many epochs. Diagnostic macro ROC AUC stays within 5 points of baseline, worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70.

Conclusion: Global self-attention vision models can better suppress demographic attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, offering practical path toward fairer chest X-ray AI systems.

Abstract: Bias in chest X-ray classifiers frequently stems from sex- and age-related shortcuts, leading to systematic underdiagnosis of minority subgroups. Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.

### [8] [Controllable Layered Image Generation for Real-World Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15507)
*Jinrui Yang,Qing Liu,Yijun Li,Mengwei Ren,Letian Zhang,Zhe Lin,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASAGNA is a unified framework that generates images with layered representations including photorealistic backgrounds and transparent foregrounds with visual effects, enabling better controllability for image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation models struggle with controllable and consistent editing of specific elements in existing images. Existing layered representation approaches often fail to produce coherent compositing relationships and lack realistic visual effects like shadows and reflections.

Method: Proposes LASAGNA framework that jointly generates images with composing layers (background + transparent foreground with visual effects). Learns correct image composition from diverse conditioning inputs: text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks. Introduces LASAGNA-48K dataset of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects, and LASAGNABENCH benchmark for layer editing.

Result: LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects.

Conclusion: LASAGNA offers greater controllability for real-world applications and will release LASAGNA-48K dataset and LASAGNABENCH benchmark to foster open research in layered image generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community. The project page is https://rayjryang.github.io/LASAGNA-Page/.

### [9] [DeltaDorsal: Enhancing Hand Pose Estimation with Dorsal Features in Egocentric Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15516)
*William Huang,Siyou Pei,Leyi Zou,Eric J. Gonzalez,Ishan Chatterjee,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hand pose estimation method using dorsal skin deformation features to overcome finger occlusion challenges in XR devices, achieving 18% error reduction in self-occluded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric hand pose estimation in XR devices faces significant challenges due to frequent finger occlusions, which degrade performance in real-world applications where fingers are often partially or fully obscured from view.

Method: Proposes a dual-stream delta encoder that learns hand pose by contrasting features from dynamic hand images with a baseline relaxed position, leveraging dense visual featurizers to extract rich information from dorsal hand skin deformation patterns.

Result: Reduces Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers ≥50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art methods, using only cropped dorsal images rather than full hand geometry and large model backbones.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reliability for downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios, enables new interaction paradigms such as detecting isometric force for surface "clicks" without visible movement, and achieves these improvements while minimizing model size.

Abstract: The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.

### [10] [VIOLA: Towards Video In-Context Learning with Minimal Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15549)
*Ryo Fujii,Hideo Saito,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIOLA is a label-efficient framework for adapting multimodal LLMs to novel video domains using minimal expert annotations and abundant unlabeled data through density-uncertainty sampling and confidence-aware mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting MLLMs to novel video domains is challenging due to labeled data scarcity, especially in specialized settings like industrial/surgical environments where expert annotations are expensive and impractical. Standard in-context learning requires large annotated pools, which are often unavailable.

Method: 1) Density-uncertainty-weighted sampling to maximize annotation efficiency by selecting diverse, representative, and informative samples. 2) Hybrid pool construction with confidence-aware retrieval (using similarity + confidence scores) and confidence-aware prompting (enabling MLLMs to distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels).

Result: Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs show VIOLA significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

Conclusion: VIOLA provides an effective framework for label-efficient adaptation of MLLMs to novel video domains by synergizing minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data through intelligent sampling and confidence-aware mechanisms.

Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

### [11] [Relative Classification Accuracy: A Calibrated Metric for Identity Consistency in Fine-Grained K-pop Face Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15560)
*Sylvey Lin,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDPMs achieve high visual quality for K-pop idol face generation but suffer from semantic mode collapse where identities get confused, especially for visually similar classes. A new metric RCA reveals this trade-off better than standard metrics like FID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation metrics (FID, IS) fail to detect identity misalignment in fine-grained, single-domain generative tasks like K-pop idol face generation where classes have high similarity. There's a need for better metrics to assess semantic controllability in conditional generative models.

Method: Proposed Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA) metric that normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Used Class-Conditional DDPMs for 32x32 K-pop idol face generation, analyzed failure modes through confusion matrices, and investigated resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity.

Result: Model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93) but suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. Confusion matrices reveal identity confusion patterns, attributed to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity.

Conclusion: The RCA metric provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models, revealing critical trade-offs between visual quality and semantic controllability that standard metrics miss. The framework helps evaluate fine-grained generative tasks better.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.

*Weiwei Wu,Yueyang Li,Yuhu Shi,Weiming Zeng,Lang Qin,Yang Yang,Ke Zhou,Zhiguo Zhang,Wai Ting Siok,Nizhuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSM-CoDG is a framework for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition that combines region-aware spatial modeling, multi-scale temporal modeling, and collaborative domain generalization to address inter-subject variability and improve generalization to unseen individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject EEG emotion recognition faces challenges from strong inter-subject variability causing distribution shifts, and the complexity of emotion-related neural representations in both spatial organization and temporal evolution. Existing approaches typically address spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, limiting their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework.

Method: Proposes RSM-CoDG framework with three key components: 1) Incorporates neuroscience priors from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations for better cross-subject comparability; 2) Employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity; 3) Uses collaborative domain generalization strategy with multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in fully unseen target subject settings.

Result: Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition.

Conclusion: RSM-CoDG offers a unified framework that successfully addresses the challenges of cross-subject EEG emotion recognition by integrating region-aware spatial modeling, multi-scale temporal modeling, and collaborative domain generalization, leading to improved generalization to unknown individuals and better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) remains challenging due to strong inter-subject variability, which induces substantial distribution shifts in EEG signals, as well as the high complexity of emotion-related neural representations in both spatial organization and temporal evolution. Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

### [13] [Explainable Deepfake Detection with RL Enhanced Self-Blended Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15624)
*Ning Jiang,Dingheng Zeng,Yanhong Liu,Haiyang Yi,Shijie Yu,Minghe Weng,Haifeng Shen,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework using automated Chain-of-Thought data generation from Self-Blended Images to address the lack of explainable outputs and high annotation costs in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs, and applying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is hindered by scarce high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations. Reinforcement learning has shown promise in improving cross-domain generalization for visual tasks.

Method: Proposes an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework with tailored reward mechanisms and feedback-driven synthetic data generation.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the CoT data construction pipeline, reward mechanism, and synthetic data generation approach. The method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework facilitates adoption of MLLMs in deepfake detection with reduced annotation costs and demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning in this context, achieving competitive performance with existing methods.

Abstract: Most prior deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs. With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning research focuses mainly on single-task scenarios, limiting applications in multi-task and multimodal settings. Multi-task continual learning introduces semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, causing severe model degradation during incremental training steps.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model with: 1) Collaborative cross-modal encoder for multimodal embedding; 2) Malleable knowledge inheritance via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation; 3) Cross-modal consistency constraint (CPP+); 4) Asymmetric pseudo-labeling for exemplar-free learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse continual learning tasks demonstrate the model's superiority, particularly in fine-grained continual learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CPP framework successfully extends continual learning to multimodal, multi-task scenarios, addressing semantic obfuscation and catastrophic forgetting through innovative techniques for multimodal alignment and knowledge preservation.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.

*Zichen Yu,Quanli Liu,Wei Wang,Liyong Zhang,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperOcc is a novel 3D occupancy prediction framework that uses superquadric representations instead of dense voxels, addressing sparsity-efficiency trade-offs with temporal modeling, multi-superquadric decoding, and efficient splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods use dense scene representations that overlook real-world driving scene sparsity. Superquadric representations offer sparse alternatives but suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, poor sparsity-geometry trade-offs, and inefficient splatting.

Method: Three key designs: (1) cohesive temporal modeling using both view-centric and object-centric cues; (2) multi-superquadric decoding to enhance geometry without sacrificing sparsity; (3) efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme for computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SuperOcc successfully addresses limitations of existing superquadric frameworks through its three novel designs, demonstrating that sparse superquadric representations can achieve both high performance and efficiency in 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-VStream is an event-aware framework for real-time video understanding that processes video as discrete semantic events rather than fixed frames, improving efficiency and long-term reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with real-time long video streams due to redundant frame processing and forgetting past context. Current streaming systems use fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, leading to repetitive outputs or loss of temporal information.

Method: Event-VStream represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. It detects meaningful state transitions using motion, semantic, and predictive cues, triggering language generation only at event boundaries. Event embeddings are consolidated into a persistent memory bank for long-horizon reasoning.

Result: Event-VStream achieves competitive performance: +10.4 points improvement over VideoLLM-Online-8B on OVOBench-Realtime, performance close to Flash-VStream-7B using only general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains ~70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

Conclusion: The event-aware approach effectively addresses real-time video understanding challenges by reducing redundancy, preserving temporal context, and enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning with low latency.

Abstract: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skywork UniPic 3.0 is a unified multimodal framework for both single-image editing and multi-image composition, achieving SOTA performance with a novel sequence-modeling approach and efficient 8-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community shows strong interest in multi-image composition (especially Human-Object Interaction tasks), but existing models lack disclosed methods for achieving high-quality fusion. Multi-image composition presents greater consistency and quality challenges than single-image editing.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis and implementation of SOTA solution for HOI-centric multi-image composition; 2) Comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline using only 700K high-quality samples; 3) Novel training paradigm formulating multi-image composition as sequence-modeling problem; 4) Integration of trajectory mapping and distribution matching for post-training acceleration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark. Supports arbitrary (1~6) input images and resolutions, arbitrary output resolutions within 1024x1024 total pixel budget. Enables 8-step inference with 12.5x speedup over standard sampling.

Conclusion: Skywork UniPic 3.0 validates the effectiveness of the proposed data pipeline and training paradigm, providing a unified solution that outperforms existing models in both single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks. Code, models, and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm. Code, models and dataset are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cr-GAN, a consistency-regularized GAN framework that synthesizes diverse SAR imagery for few-shot learning by decoupling adversarial training from representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot recognition in SAR imagery faces extreme data scarcity. Traditional GAN-based data augmentation approaches fail because GANs themselves require abundant training data, creating a paradox in few-shot learning scenarios.

Method: Introduces Cr-GAN with dual-branch discriminator to separate adversarial training from representation learning. Uses channel-wise feature interpolation to create novel latent features and dual-domain cycle consistency to ensure semantic integrity. Framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures.

Result: Achieves 71.21% accuracy on MSTAR and 51.64% on SRSDD datasets in 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming baselines. Requires only ~5% parameters compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Conclusion: Cr-GAN effectively resolves the data scarcity paradox in few-shot SAR recognition by enabling stable GAN training with limited data, providing high-quality synthetic samples that boost self-supervised learning performance.

Abstract: Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

*Zhixuan Liang,Xingyu Zeng,Rui Zhao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGRAL is a reinforcement learning-based active learning method for object detection that uses mAP improvement as reward to guide sample selection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active learning approaches for object detection focus on data distribution or intrinsic information content rather than directly optimizing for downstream task performance (mAP), leading to suboptimal sample selection.

Method: Proposes MGRAL which uses expected model output changes as informativeness measure, employs reinforcement learning sampling agent with policy gradient optimization using mAP improvement as reward, and reduces computational overhead through unsupervised fast look-up tables for mAP estimation.

Result: Achieves highest active learning curve on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks with convincing visualizations, establishing new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.

Conclusion: MGRAL successfully bridges the gap between sample informativeness and downstream task performance, demonstrating that reinforcement learning with performance-guided rewards can effectively optimize active learning for object detection tasks.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced complex security challenges, particularly at the intersection of textual and visual safety. While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes three lightweight refinements to improve SAR-based land-use/land-cover semantic segmentation in Japan, addressing boundary smoothing, missed thin structures, and rare-class degradation without increasing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses common failure modes in SAR dense-prediction tasks: boundary over-smoothing, missed thin/slender structures, and rare-class degradation under long-tailed label distributions, particularly for national-scale LULC segmentation using ALOS-2 SAR data over Japan.

Method: Three lightweight refinements: (1) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (2) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (3) an α-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective.

Result: The model yields consistent improvements on the Japan-wide ALOS-2 LULC benchmark, particularly for under-represented classes, and improves water detection across standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight refinements effectively address common SAR segmentation challenges without increasing pipeline complexity, demonstrating improved performance for national-scale LULC mapping and water detection tasks.

Abstract: This work focuses on national-scale land-use/land-cover (LULC) semantic segmentation using ALOS-2 single-polarization (HH) SAR data over Japan, together with a companion binary water detection task. Building on SAR-W-MixMAE self-supervised pretraining [1], we address common SAR dense-prediction failure modes, boundary over-smoothing, missed thin/slender structures, and rare-class degradation under long-tailed labels, without increasing pipeline complexity. We introduce three lightweight refinements: (i) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (ii) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (iii) an $α$-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective. The resulting model yields consistent improvements on the Japan-wide ALOS-2 LULC benchmark, particularly for under-represented classes, and improves water detection across standard evaluation metrics.

*Shubham Shukla,Kunal Sonalkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs outperform traditional methods on fashion attribute prediction but struggle with detecting when attributes are applicable vs. not applicable, with efficient models offering 90% of flagship performance at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained attribute prediction is crucial for fashion retail applications, but current VLMs lack systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks where attributes can be conditional (applicable only when visible).

Method: Introduced three-tier evaluation framework: (1) overall task performance across all classes including NA, (2) attribute applicability detection, (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Benchmarked 9 VLMs across flagship, efficient, and ultra-efficient tiers against Fashion-CLIP embeddings on DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset with 5,000 images and 18 attributes.

Result: VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1 (3x improvement over logistic regression on Fashion-CLIP), excel at fine-grained classification (70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (34.1% NA-F1). Efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost.

Conclusion: The diagnostic framework helps identify whether errors come from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements. Efficient VLMs offer practical deployment paths for fashion attribute prediction systems.

Abstract: Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoThinker is an agentic Video Large Language Model trained on synthetic tool interaction trajectories to overcome limitations in long-form video understanding, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs struggle with long-form video understanding due to static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which causes temporal localization issues and information loss. While agentic tools (temporal retrieval, spatial/temporal zoom) could help, there's a circular dependency: creating agentic video data requires models that already have strong long-form comprehension.

Method: 1) Convert videos into rich captions, 2) Use a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space, 3) Ground trajectories back to video by replacing captions with corresponding frames, creating synthetic interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset, 4) Train VideoThinker on this synthetic agentic dataset.

Result: VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating effective tool-augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval/zoom reasoning.

Conclusion: The synthetic agentic training approach successfully breaks the circular dependency problem, enabling VideoThinker to develop dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use for superior long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for current Video Large Language Models. Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models struggle with multi-modal medical imaging due to ineffective information fusion and adaptation to heterogeneous pathological tissues, creating a critical unresolved challenge.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Sub-region-aware modality attention that learns optimal modality combinations for each tumor sub-region, and 2) Adaptive prompt engineering that leverages foundation model capabilities to refine segmentation accuracy.

Result: Framework validated on BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, significantly outperforming baseline methods, with particularly strong performance in the challenging necrotic core sub-region.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.

Abstract: The successful adaptation of foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging is a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region. Our work provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.

*Xinjue Hu,Chi Wang,Boyu Wang,Xiang Zhang,Zhenshan Tan,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARDIS is the first Arbitrary Resolution Deep Image Steganography framework that enables hiding and recovering secret images at any resolution without requiring pre-resampling or known resolution values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DIS methods require secret and cover images to have the same resolution, forcing resampling that causes detail loss and preventing recovery to original resolution when resolution is unknown.

Method: 1) Frequency Decoupling Architecture separates secret into resolution-aligned global basis and resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent. 2) Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor uses continuous implicit function to restore high-frequency details. 3) Implicit Resolution Coding embeds resolution information as dense feature maps for blind recovery.

Result: ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully shifts from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction, enabling arbitrary resolution steganography with faithful detail restoration.

Abstract: Deep image steganography (DIS) has achieved significant results in capacity and invisibility. However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for hyperspectral image classification rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, which limits interpretability and prevents understanding of internal decision mechanisms. There's a need for more transparent models that reveal how different electromagnetic spectrum groupings interact during classification.

Method: ES-mHC uses a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual streams) using structured, directional matrices. The approach separates feature representation from interaction structure, allowing electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization and reducing redundancy.

Result: The learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into model internal dynamics. Increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns.

Conclusion: ES-mHC transforms hyperspectral image classification from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process that enables direct visualization and spatial analysis of internal information flow.

Abstract: In hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), most deep learning models rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting their interpretability and hindering understanding of internal decision mechanisms. We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.

*Qi Zeng,Weide Liu,Bo Li,Ryne Didier,P. Ellen Grant,Davood Karimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeTal-SAM adapts Segment Anything Model for fetal brain MRI segmentation using atlas-based prompts, enabling flexible segmentation without retraining for different label definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods require large annotated datasets for fixed label sets and lack flexibility when clinical/research needs change. They also don't reveal whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or learned spatial priors.

Method: Integrates atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles. Uses multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates as dense prompts, plus bounding-box prompts for SAM's decoder. Performs binary segmentation per-structure then fuses to reconstruct full 3D volumes.

Result: Achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines for well-contrasted structures (cortical plate, cerebellum) across gestational ages on dHCP and in-house datasets. Slightly lower accuracy for subtle, low-contrast structures (hippocampus, amygdala). Maintains flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy.

Conclusion: FeTal-SAM offers a promising general-purpose segmentation model for fetal brain MRI without exhaustive retraining, representing a step toward clinically adaptable analysis tools.

Abstract: This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LL-GaussianMap is the first unsupervised framework using 2D Gaussian Splatting for low-light image enhancement, formulating enhancement as gain map generation guided by 2DGS primitives to preserve structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing low-light enhancement methods operate in pixel domain or use implicit features, neglecting intrinsic geometric structural priors. 2D Gaussian Splatting offers superior structural fitting but hasn't been explored for low-level vision tasks.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) High-fidelity structural reconstruction using 2DGS, 2) Data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients rendered via Gaussian splatting rasterization through a unified enhancement module. Formulates enhancement as gain map generation guided by 2DGS primitives.

Result: Achieves superior enhancement performance with extremely low storage footprint, demonstrating effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement while preserving edges and suppressing artifacts.

Conclusion: LL-GaussianMap successfully bridges the gap by incorporating 2DGS into low-light enhancement, showing that explicit Gaussian representations can effectively preserve structural priors and achieve high-quality enhancement with minimal storage requirements.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.

TL;DR: LL-GaussianImage is a zero-shot unsupervised framework for low-light enhancement directly within 2DGS compressed representation domain, avoiding decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light enhancement algorithms work in pixel domain, requiring decompression of 2DGS-compressed images, which is inefficient and causes secondary degradation. There's a need for direct enhancement within the compressed representation domain.

Method: 1) Semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts framework using rendered images as guidance for dynamic adaptive transformations in sparse attribute space; 2) Multi-objective collaborative loss function system for smoothness and fidelity constraints; 3) Two-stage optimization process with single-scale reconstruction for base representation accuracy.

Result: Achieves high-quality low-light image enhancement while maintaining high compression ratios, validating feasibility of direct processing within compressed representation domain.

Conclusion: LL-GaussianImage demonstrates superior paradigm for low-light enhancement directly in 2DGS compressed domain, eliminating need for decompression pipeline while preserving compression efficiency and image quality.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is an emerging explicit scene representation method with significant potential for image compression due to high fidelity and high compression ratios. However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.

*Liuyun Jiang,Yanchao Zhang,Jinyue Guo,Yizhuo Lu,Ruining Zhou,Hua Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based data augmentation framework generates diverse, structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation in EM, improving performance in low-annotation regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for neuron segmentation require large-scale annotated data, which is time-consuming to obtain. Traditional augmentation methods produce highly correlated samples lacking structural diversity, limiting segmentation performance.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-based framework with: 1) resolution-aware conditional diffusion model using multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors for voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks, and 2) biology-guided mask remodeling module for enhanced structural realism in augmented masks.

Result: On AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, improves ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7% respectively when combined with two different post-processing methods.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based data augmentation framework effectively enriches training sets with diverse, structurally plausible samples, significantly improving neuron segmentation performance in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) aims to reconstruct the complete neuronal connectome; however, current deep learning-based methods are limited by their reliance on large-scale training data and extensive, time-consuming manual annotations. Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods.

*Pascal Benschop,Justin Dauwels,Jan van Gemert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning tasks involving subtle temporal/geometric cues, performing only slightly above chance on a new synthetic benchmark testing situational and spatial awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial reasoning in VLMs remains fragile when semantics depend on subtle temporal or geometric cues, and current benchmarks don't adequately test these capabilities.

Method: Created a synthetic benchmark with minimal video pairs testing three challenges: violence vs benign activity distinction, assailant role binding across viewpoints, and fine-grained trajectory alignment judgment.

Result: Recent VLMs perform only slightly above chance across all tasks. Stable color cues partly reduce assailant role confusion but don't resolve underlying weaknesses.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides reproducible diagnostics and seeds exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining, as current VLMs lack robust spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.

Motivation: Flowers have many uses but identifying them requires expert knowledge, which isn't always accessible. A mobile app using CNNs can provide non-specialists with quick flower identification.

Method: Developed a mobile application using three CNN models (MobileNet, DenseNet121, Xception) and evaluated them with seven different optimization algorithms to find the best model for mobile deployment.

Result: DenseNet-121 with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization achieved the best performance: 95.84% accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: CNNs can be effectively used for flower classification in mobile applications, with DenseNet121+SGD being the most suitable model for this purpose.

Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that has been specifically designed for computer vision applications. The CNNs proved successful in handling the increasing amount of data in many computer vision problems, where classical machine learning algorithms were insufficient. Flowers have many uses in our daily lives, from decorating to making medicines to detoxifying the environment. Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge. However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score. This result shows that CNNs can be used for flower classification in mobile applications.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight experimentation pipeline designed to lower the barrier for applying machine learning (ML) methods for classifying images in ecological research. We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems.

TL;DR: First application of dataset distillation to remote sensing imagery using diffusion models with classifier guidance and semantic clustering to create compact, representative training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of large-scale remote sensing datasets: high storage/computational costs and data leakage risks, especially for sensitive categories.

Method: Train text-to-image diffusion model to condense large datasets, using classifier-driven guidance (classification consistency loss) and latent space clustering for representative prototypes with visual language model text descriptions.

Result: Method successfully distills realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dataset distillation is effective for remote sensing image interpretation, enabling compact, representative datasets that reduce storage/computational costs while mitigating data leakage risks.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/DPD).

Conclusion: TinySense provides an efficient compression framework that enhances scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing while maintaining accuracy, making it practical for real-world deployment with reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PMPBench: first public, fully paired pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 organs with complete DCE-MR sequences and paired CT/CTC, enabling rigorous evaluation of contrast synthesis methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrast medium is crucial for radiological imaging but not always feasible due to patient health or resource constraints. Existing datasets are limited to brain MR, have partial pairing, missing modalities, poor alignment, and lack phase labeling. Most resources remain private, hindering AI-based contrast synthesis research.

Method: Created a public, fully paired pan-cancer dataset covering 11 human organs with complete DCE-MR sequences (all three phases: DCE1-DCE3) and paired CT/CTC acquisitions. Curated for anatomical correspondence to enable evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings. Established comprehensive benchmark with representative image-to-image translation baselines.

Result: Released the first public, fully paired pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 organs. Provided benchmark results from contemporary image-to-image translation methods. Made code and dataset publicly available to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis for multi-organ oncology imaging.

Conclusion: PMPBench addresses critical data limitations in contrast synthesis research by providing a comprehensive, publicly available dataset and benchmark. This resource enables rigorous evaluation of AI methods for synthesizing contrast-enhanced images from non-contrast scans, potentially reducing side effects and streamlining clinical workflows in multi-organ oncology imaging.

Abstract: Contrast medium plays a pivotal role in radiological imaging, as it amplifies lesion conspicuity and improves detection for the diagnosis of tumor-related diseases. However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/YifanChen02/PMPBench.

TL;DR: VFMs show uneven downstream performance due to pretraining-task mismatch; alignment measured by MMD correlates with better transfer learning in prostate MRI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models (VFMs) show inconsistent improvements across downstream tasks despite large computational investment, likely due to misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream task requirements.

Method: Evaluate two VFMs (MAE-based ProFound and contrastive-learning-based ProViCNet) on five prostate multiparametric MRI tasks, measuring task alignment using maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between features before and after fine-tuning.

Result: Better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks (measured by MMD) correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence during fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Pretraining objectives should be designed with downstream applicability in mind, as task alignment significantly impacts transfer learning effectiveness in vision foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.

*Anas Anwarul Haq Khan,Mariam Husain,Kshitij Jadhav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadJEPA is a self-supervised framework for radiology that learns visual representations without language supervision by predicting masked image regions in latent space, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language models rely on paired image-text data, which is limited. The authors question whether robust radiology encoders can be learned without language supervision, aiming to overcome data constraints.

Method: RadJEPA uses a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images. It learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions, focusing on latent-space prediction rather than global representation alignment.

Result: RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches (including Rad-DINO) across disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that robust radiology encoders can be effectively learned without language supervision through self-supervised predictive objectives, offering a promising alternative to image-text pre-training.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision language models guide the learning of visual representations; however, this form of supervision is constrained by the availability of paired image text data, raising the question of whether robust radiology encoders can be learned without relying on language supervision. In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks. Across benchmarks, RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches, including Rad-DINO.

*Zhaoqi Su,Shihai Chen,Xinyan Lin,Liqin Huang,Zhipeng Su,Xiaoqiang Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThermoSplat extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to multi-spectral RGB+thermal reconstruction using cross-modal feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling for improved rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal scene reconstruction with RGB and thermal data is crucial for robust perception in varying conditions, but current 3DGS approaches struggle to effectively leverage complementary multi-modal information and handle cross-modal correlations and physical discrepancies.

Method: Proposes ThermoSplat with: 1) Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation that conditions shared features on thermal structural priors, 2) Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling with independent opacity offsets and rasterization for thermal branch, and 3) hybrid rendering combining explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on RGBT-Scenes dataset show ThermoSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both visible and thermal spectrums.

Conclusion: ThermoSplat successfully addresses limitations in multi-spectral 3DGS by enabling deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling, demonstrating superior performance in RGB-thermal scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal scene reconstruction integrating RGB and thermal infrared data is essential for robust environmental perception across diverse lighting and weather conditions. However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on the RGBT-Scenes dataset demonstrate that ThermoSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both visible and thermal spectrums.

*Zhen Zhang,Runhao Zeng,Sicheng Zhao,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper finds that affective capabilities in multimodal foundation models are primarily mediated by feed-forward gating projections (gate_proj), not attention modules, enabling efficient emotion adaptation with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong empirical performance of affective models, there's limited understanding of how emotions are represented internally in multimodal foundation models and which architectural mechanisms support affective understanding and generation.

Method: Systematic mechanistic study across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks; analysis of how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes parameters; controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation experiments.

Result: Affective adaptation consistently localizes to feed-forward gating projections (gate_proj), not attention modules; gate_proj is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective tasks; tuning only ~24.5% of parameters achieves 96.6% of AffectGPT's performance across eight tasks.

Conclusion: Affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms, with gate_proj identified as the central architectural locus for affective modeling, enabling highly parameter-efficient emotion adaptation.

Abstract: Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.

*Yarin Benyamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking SOTA models for real-time emotion recognition in VR therapy for ASD reveals a "Latency Wall" - while face detection works well on stylized avatars, general-purpose Transformers fail to meet both accuracy (<23%) and speed (>150ms) requirements for real-time VR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time emotion recognition in VR/HCI could help individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder improve social skills, but requires strict latency-accuracy trade-offs (MTP latency <140ms). Most existing DL models prioritize accuracy over timing constraints, creating a need for accessible VR therapy solutions.

Method: Benchmarked SOTA models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition on virtual characters using UIBVFED dataset. Evaluated Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, v12) for face detection, and general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER. Conducted CPU-only inference testing.

Result: Face detection on stylized avatars achieved 100% accuracy, but classification stage revealed a "Latency Wall." YOLOv11n offered optimal balance for detection (~54ms). General-purpose Transformers (CLIP, SigLIP) failed to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150ms) for real-time loops.

Conclusion: Lightweight, domain-specific architectures are necessary to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic VR settings. Current general-purpose models cannot meet both latency and accuracy requirements for ASD therapy applications.

Abstract: In the realm of Virtual Reality (VR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), real-time emotion recognition shows promise for supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving social skills. This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.

TL;DR: A robust multi-view pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery using off-the-shelf models without domain fine-tuning, plus a new surgical benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D hand pose estimation is crucial for surgical applications (skill assessment, robot-assisted interventions, workflow analysis), but surgical environments present severe challenges: intense lighting, frequent occlusions, uniform glove appearance, and scarcity of annotated datasets.

Method: Multi-view pipeline integrating person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by constrained 3D optimization. Uses only off-the-shelf pretrained models without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Establishes strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate 3D hand pose estimation supports surgical applications such as skill assessment, robot-assisted interventions, and geometry-aware workflow analysis. However, surgical environments pose severe challenges, including intense and localized lighting, frequent occlusions by instruments or staff, and uniform hand appearance due to gloves, combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets for reliable model training.
  Method: We propose a robust multi-view pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgical contexts that requires no domain-specific fine-tuning and relies solely on off-the-shelf pretrained models. The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.
  Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.
  Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.

### [47] [Class Confidence Aware Reweighting for Long Tailed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15924)
*Brainard Philemon Jagati,Jitendra Tembhurne,Harsh Goud,Rudra Pratap Singh,Chandrashekhar Meshram*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning that modulates training contributions based on prediction confidence and class frequency, complementing existing logit adjustment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks degrade significantly in long-tailed data distributions where head classes dominate training data and tail classes have few examples. Existing methods focus mainly on logit-level adjustments for class-prior bias, with little attention to optimization process adjustments based on confidence differences among samples.

Method: Designs a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme operating purely at the loss level. Uses an Ω(p_t, f_c) function that modulates contribution to training based on prediction confidence value and relative class frequency. This complements existing logit adjustment methods.

Result: Significant experimental results on CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various imbalance factors validate the theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The proposed confidence-aware re-weighting scheme effectively addresses long-tailed learning by considering both class frequency and prediction confidence, providing a complementary approach to existing logit adjustment methods with strong empirical validation across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroMamba: A multi-perspective framework for neuron segmentation that combines patch-free global modeling using Mamba's linear complexity with local feature modeling to capture long-range dependencies while preserving voxel-level details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuron segmentation is crucial for reconstructing neuronal connectomes to understand brain function, but existing methods have limitations: CNN-based methods lack long-range context for ambiguous boundaries, while Transformer-based methods lose voxel-level details during patch partitioning.

Method: Proposes NeuroMamba framework with three key components: 1) Channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) for local morphological cues, 2) Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE) with resolution-aware scanning mechanism in Visual Mamba architecture for adaptive global dependency modeling, and 3) Cross-modulation mechanism to synergistically fuse multi-perspective features.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, showing exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

Conclusion: NeuroMamba effectively addresses limitations of both CNN and Transformer approaches by enabling patch-free global modeling while preserving fine-grained voxel details, making it a promising solution for challenging neuron segmentation tasks in brain connectome reconstruction.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation is the cornerstone of reconstructing comprehensive neuronal connectomes, which is essential for deciphering the functional organization of the brain. The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions. The source code will be made publicly available.

*Sheng Miao,Sijin Li,Pan Wang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu,Yue Wang,Andreas Geiger,Yiyi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvolSplat4D is a feed-forward framework for novel view synthesis of urban scenes that unifies volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches to handle static close-range, dynamic actors, and far-field regions, achieving better quality and consistency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis in autonomous driving simulation struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. Neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches are photorealistic but require time-consuming per-scene optimization, while feed-forward methods using per-pixel Gaussian representations suffer from 3D inconsistencies in complex dynamic environments.

Method: EvolSplat4D uses three specialized branches: 1) For close-range static regions, predicts consistent 3D Gaussian geometry from a 3D feature volume with semantically-enhanced image-based rendering for appearance; 2) For dynamic actors, uses object-centric canonical spaces and motion-adjusted rendering to aggregate temporal features; 3) For far-field scenery, employs an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch for full-scene coverage.

Result: Experimental results on KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization methods and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.

Conclusion: EvolSplat4D successfully addresses the trade-off between reconstruction time and quality in novel view synthesis for urban scenes by moving beyond per-pixel paradigms and unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction, enabling efficient and high-quality reconstruction of complex static and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of static and dynamic urban scenes is essential for autonomous driving simulation, yet existing methods often struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperAlign trains a hypernetwork to generate low-rank adaptation weights for test-time alignment of diffusion models, avoiding diversity loss and computational overhead while improving semantic consistency and visual appeal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often fail to align with human preferences, producing images with poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing methods face trade-offs: fine-tuning loses diversity through reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling has high computational overhead and under-optimizes.

Method: HyperAlign trains a hypernetwork that dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate diffusion model's generation operators based on input latents, timesteps, and prompts. Multiple variants balance performance and efficiency by varying hypernetwork application frequency. The hypernetwork is optimized using reward score objective regularized with preference data to prevent reward hacking.

Result: HyperAlign significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal across multiple generative paradigms including Stable Diffusion and FLUX.

Conclusion: HyperAlign provides an efficient and effective test-time alignment framework that avoids the limitations of existing methods, achieving better alignment with human preferences while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance but often fail to generate outputs that align with human preferences and intentions, resulting in images with poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysicsMind is a new benchmark that evaluates multimodal AI models' understanding of basic physics principles (Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, Newton's First Law) through VQA and video generation tasks, revealing current models rely on appearance heuristics and violate fundamental mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models excel at mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning but lack proper understanding of physics. Existing benchmarks use synthetic templates or focus on perceptual quality rather than evaluating adherence to physical laws.

Method: Created PhysicsMind benchmark with real and simulation environments evaluating three physics principles. Includes two main tasks: 1) VQA tasks testing reasoning about physical quantities from images/videos, and 2) Video Generation tasks evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey physical constraints.

Result: Evaluation of recent models shows they rely on appearance heuristics and often violate basic mechanics. Current scaling and training are insufficient for robust physical understanding.

Conclusion: PhysicsMind serves as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models, highlighting the need for better physical reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Modern foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video world models have advanced significantly in mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning, but their grasp of the underlying physics remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes a reinforcement learning-based keyframe selection method for visual foundation model-based visual odometry to improve efficiency and accuracy by reducing computational redundancy from low-parallax frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual foundation model-based VO methods process all frames indiscriminately, causing computational redundancy and degraded performance from low inter-frame parallax. Traditional geometric heuristics don't work well with these models since they rely on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. Trained on TartanAir dataset.

Result: Experimental results across several real-world datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning-based keyframe selection effectively bridges the gap between traditional geometric heuristics and modern foundation model-based VO, improving both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The emergence of visual foundation models has revolutionized visual odometry~(VO) and SLAM, enabling pose estimation and dense reconstruction within a single feed-forward network. However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

*Rongze Ma,Mengkang Lu,Zhenyu Xiang,Yongsheng Pan,Yicheng Wu,Qingjie Zeng,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAINT is a visual autoregressive framework for virtual immunohistochemistry that synthesizes molecular staining patterns from H&E images using structure-first conditional generation with spatial structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual IHC offers cost-effective alternatives to physical staining, but existing methods struggle with semantic inconsistencies due to ambiguous morphological cues and insufficient structural priors in H&E images.

Method: PAINT reformulates synthesis as structure-first conditional generation using a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map) to ground autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, enforcing causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on global structural layout.

Result: PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on IHC4BC and MIST datasets in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The structure-guided autoregressive modeling approach validates the potential of deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis for virtual immunohistochemistry.

Abstract: Virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) aims to computationally synthesize molecular staining patterns from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) images, offering a cost-effective and tissue-efficient alternative to traditional physical staining. However, this task is particularly challenging: H\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.

TL;DR: ProGiDiff: A novel framework that adapts pre-trained diffusion models for medical image segmentation using ControlNet-style conditioning with custom encoder, enabling multi-class segmentation via natural language prompts and cross-modality adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation methods are deterministic, lack natural language prompt capability, cannot estimate multiple proposals, and have limited human interaction and cross-modality adaptation. Text-to-image diffusion models show potential but require large datasets for training and are often limited to binary segmentation.

Method: Proposes ProGiDiff framework with ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism using a custom encoder to steer pre-trained diffusion models to output segmentation masks. Enables multi-class segmentation by prompting target organ, and supports few-shot cross-modality adaptation through low-rank adaptation.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on organ segmentation from CT images compared to previous methods, benefits from expert-in-the-loop settings with multiple proposals, and shows easy transferability to MR images through few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: ProGiDiff successfully bridges the gap between deterministic segmentation methods and flexible, prompt-based approaches by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, enabling natural language interaction, multiple proposals, and cross-modality adaptation in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models often overly attend to task-irrelevant image regions (distracting tokens), which disrupts action generation and reduces task success rates. The authors aim to correct visual attention patterns to improve performance without modifying the original model architecture.

Method: The Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework dynamically detects and prunes distracting image tokens by analyzing attention patterns. It's a plug-and-play approach that doesn't alter the original VLA model architecture or require additional inputs.

Result: Experiments on SIMPLER Benchmark show consistent relative improvements in task success rates across different VLA models. Analysis reveals a negative correlation between task success rate and attention to task-irrelevant regions, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs.

Conclusion: The DTP framework effectively improves VLA model performance by pruning distracting tokens, revealing a common attention pattern issue in VLA models that could guide future research. The method is simple, effective, and architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have strong generalization but face deployment challenges in federated settings due to high computational demands, communication overhead, and inference costs, especially for medical image segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes DSFedMed with dual-scale federated framework enabling mutual knowledge distillation between centralized foundation model and lightweight client models. Uses generated high-quality medical images instead of real public datasets, and implements learnability-guided sample selection for efficient dual-scale distillation.

Result: Achieves average 2% improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90% compared to existing federated foundation model baselines across five medical imaging segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: DSFedMed demonstrates significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments, enabling practical use of foundation models in medical imaging while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.

*Zhiyin Qian,Siwei Zhang,Bharat Lal Bhatnagar,Federica Bogo,Siyu Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRo is a real-time human motion reconstruction framework that uses masked modeling to handle occlusions in monocular videos, achieving 70 FPS performance while outperforming SOTA methods in occluded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is challenging under real-world occlusions. Existing methods either lack robustness to missing observations (regression-based) or are too slow (optimization/diffusion-based) with heavy preprocessing requirements.

Method: MoRo uses masked modeling for occlusion-robust motion recovery, formulating it as a video-conditioned task. It employs a cross-modality learning scheme with three components: (1) trajectory-aware motion prior from MoCap data, (2) image-conditioned pose prior from image-pose data, and (3) video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses these priors, fine-tuned on video-motion datasets.

Result: MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions on EgoBody and RICH datasets, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. It achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

Conclusion: MoRo provides an efficient, end-to-end solution for occlusion-robust human motion reconstruction that combines the benefits of generative modeling with real-time performance, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings.Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

Conclusion: SAMTok demonstrates a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities without architectural modifications or specialized loss design, enabling more effective interactive intelligent systems.

Abstract: Pixel-wise capabilities are essential for building interactive intelligent systems. However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.

Conclusion: CSSMamba effectively addresses token sequence challenges in Mamba models for HSI classification through clustering integration, achieving superior performance in both accuracy and boundary preservation.

Abstract: Although Mamba models greatly improve Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification, they have critical challenges in terms defining efficient and adaptive token sequences for improve performance. This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods.

Conclusion: EDIR provides a rigorous benchmark that exposes current model limitations and clarifies task challenges by distinguishing between categories solvable with targeted data versus those exposing intrinsic architectural limitations.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a pivotal and complex task in multimodal understanding. Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-space watermarking methods for AI-generated images have computational overhead and can introduce visual artifacts, motivating the exploration of more efficient latent space approaches.

Method: Train post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models (both diffusion and autoregressive), then distill these latent watermarkers either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder for in-model watermarking.

Result: Latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness with similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones in both efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: DistSeal provides a unified latent space watermarking solution that is more efficient and robust than pixel-space approaches, working across different generative model architectures.

Abstract: Existing approaches for watermarking AI-generated images often rely on post-hoc methods applied in pixel space, introducing computational overhead and potential visual artifacts. In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.

TL;DR: ActionMesh is a generative model that produces production-ready animated 3D meshes from various inputs (video, text, or 3D mesh + text) using temporal 3D diffusion, offering fast generation with rig-free, topology-consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D animation generation methods have practical limitations including complex setups, long runtimes, and limited quality, making them difficult to apply in real-world applications that require production-ready animated 3D objects.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Adapt 3D diffusion models to generate synchronized latent sequences representing time-varying 3D shapes, 2) Design a temporal 3D autoencoder that converts independent shapes into deformations of a reference shape to create animations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) for both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, with unprecedented speed and quality compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: ActionMesh enables practical generation of animated 3D meshes that are rig-free and topology-consistent, facilitating rapid iteration and seamless application in workflows like texturing and retargeting.

Abstract: Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP-based text-video retrieval methods suffer from "blind" feature interaction where models struggle to distinguish key visual information from background noise due to sparse textual queries, leading to inefficient matching.

Method: Proposes Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model with coarse-to-fine alignment: 1) Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) mimics human macro-perception by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy; 2) Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM) simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities using advanced attention mechanism for precise entity-level matching.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-video retrieval.

Conclusion: The HVD framework successfully addresses the "blind" feature interaction problem in text-video retrieval by mimicking human cognitive vision processes, establishing a more effective coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: The success of CLIP has driven substantial progress in text-video retrieval. However, current methods often suffer from "blind" feature interaction, where the model struggles to discern key visual information from background noise due to the sparsity of textual queries. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from human cognitive behavior and propose the Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model. Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy. Subsequently, PFCM simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities through an advanced attention mechanism, enabling precise entity-level matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 360Anything demonstrates deep geometric understanding without explicit camera metadata, enabling broader utility in computer vision tasks and effective handling of in-the-wild data through a purely data-driven approach.

Abstract: Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

TL;DR: RAEs outperform VAEs for large-scale text-to-image generation, showing better stability, faster convergence, and superior quality across model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) can scale effectively to large-scale, freeform text-to-image generation, building on their success in ImageNet diffusion modeling.

Method: 1) Scale RAE decoders on frozen SigLIP-2 encoder using web, synthetic, and text-rendering data; 2) Stress-test RAE design choices from ImageNet; 3) Conduct controlled comparison of RAE vs. FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales (0.5B to 9.8B parameters).

Result: RAEs consistently outperform VAEs across all model scales during pretraining. During finetuning, VAEs catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs while RAEs remain stable through 256 epochs with better performance. RAEs show faster convergence and better generation quality.

Conclusion: RAEs establish a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. The shared representation space enables multimodal models to directly reason over generated latents, opening possibilities for unified models.

Abstract: Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.

Result: Achieves SOTA video reconstruction, improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding across ten benchmarks, scaling to 4K/8K resolutions.

Conclusion: PyraTok demonstrates that language-aligned pyramidal tokenization with multi-scale discrete latents enables superior cross-modal alignment and robust zero-shot transfer for video generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.

TL;DR: RCORE framework addresses object-driven verb shortcuts in zero-shot compositional action recognition by enforcing temporally grounded verb learning through composition-aware augmentation and temporal order regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail due to object-driven verb shortcuts, where models ignore visual evidence and overfit to co-occurrence statistics, preventing generalization to unseen verb-object compositions.

Method: Proposed RCORE framework with two key components: (1) composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (2) temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure.

Result: RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy across Sth-com and EK100-com benchmarks, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps.

Conclusion: Object-driven shortcuts are a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR, and addressing them through temporally grounded verb learning is essential for robust compositional video understanding.

Abstract: We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.

### [68] [CamPilot: Improving Camera Control in Video Diffusion Model with Efficient Camera Reward Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16214)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CamPilot improves camera controllability in video diffusion models by introducing a camera-aware 3D decoder that converts video latent into 3D Gaussians for reward quantization, addressing limitations of existing ReFL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camera-controlled video diffusion models have limited camera controllability, and existing Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) approaches face three key challenges: lack of reward models for video-camera alignment assessment, computational overhead from RGB decoding, and neglect of 3D geometric information during decoding.

Method: Introduces an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent along with camera pose into 3D Gaussians. The camera pose serves as both input and projection parameter, where misalignment causes geometric distortions. Optimizes pixel-level consistency between rendered novel views and ground-truth as reward, with a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions via geometric warping to accommodate stochastic nature.

Result: Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving camera controllability.

Conclusion: CamPilot successfully addresses the limitations of existing ReFL approaches by leveraging 3D geometric representations for reward quantization, enabling more effective camera control in video diffusion models through novel view consistency optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
