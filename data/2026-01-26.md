### [1] [GR3EN: Generative Relighting for 3D Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16272)
*Xiaoyan Xing,Philipp Henzler,Junhwa Hur,Runze Li,Jonathan T. Barron,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Dor Verbin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for relighting 3D reconstructions of room-scale environments by distilling outputs from a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into 3D reconstructions, avoiding difficult inverse rendering problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene relighting methods often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, producing poor results on complex real-world scenes. Current generative diffusion approaches are limited to 2D image/video relighting or individual 3D objects, not room-scale environments.

Method: Distills outputs from a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into 3D reconstructions, bypassing traditional inverse rendering problems. This creates a flexible system for controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes.

Result: Validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing faithful rendering of novel views under new lighting conditions for complex real-world scenes.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-quality 3D relighting of room-scale environments by leveraging generative diffusion models while avoiding the limitations of traditional inverse rendering methods.

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

*Dohun Lee,Chun-Hao Paul Huang,Xuelin Chen,Jong Chul Ye,Duygu Ceylan,Hyeonho Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-V2V introduces a memory-augmented framework for multi-turn video editing that maintains cross-consistency across sequential edits while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editors struggle with maintaining cross-consistency across multiple rounds of iterative video editing, which is common in real-world editing workflows.

Method: Augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory using accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies, plus a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone to reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves significantly better cross-consistency with minimal computational overhead (30% speedup), while maintaining or improving task-specific performance on video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing.

Conclusion: Memory-V2V effectively addresses the cross-consistency problem in multi-turn video editing through memory augmentation and efficient token compression.

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Abhijeet Parida,Antonia Alomar,Zhifan Jiang,Pooneh Roshanitabrizi,Austin Tapp,Ziyue Xu,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Maria J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Holger R. Roth,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeTTL is a federated learning framework that learns a global template and task model to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on retinal and histopathological tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across medical centers, but domain shifts and data heterogeneity degrade model performance, especially in medical imaging with variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations.

Method: Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL) learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients in federated environments.

Result: FeTTL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and metastasis classification from multi-institutional data, highlighting the importance of jointly learning template and task.

Conclusion: FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional medical imaging environments.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

### [4] [Where is the multimodal goal post? On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333)
*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Models struggle to identify important sub-events in football videos, performing near chance level despite using human preference data from highlight reels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are used for real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events, but their ability to identify important sub-events - a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing - needs evaluation.

Method: Constructed a new dataset using human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels without additional annotation costs. Evaluated several state-of-the-art multimodal models on distinguishing important vs non-important sub-events.

Result: Models perform not far from chance level. Analysis reveals models tend to rely on a single dominant modality and are ineffective at synthesizing information from multiple sources.

Conclusion: Need modular architectures to handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and complementary training procedures to maximize cross-modal synergy.

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

### [5] [Coarse-to-Fine Non-rigid Multi-modal Image Registration for Historical Panel Paintings based on Crack Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16348)
*Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method for historical panel paintings using craquelure patterns, neural networks for keypoint detection/matching, and multi-level refinement for mixed-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-wise alignment of multi-modal images (visual light, infrared, UV, x-ray, macro) for art analysis is laborious and time-consuming. Automated registration is needed to handle varying resolutions, large sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent content.

Method: One-stage non-rigid registration using: 1) CNN for joint keypoint detection/description based on craquelure patterns, 2) Graph neural network for patch-based descriptor matching, 3) Homography reprojection error filtering, 4) Novel multi-level keypoint refinement for mixed-resolution images up to highest resolution, 5) Thin-plate-splines for non-rigid transformation.

Result: Created multi-modal dataset with keypoint annotations and large test set across five domains. Ablation study confirms effectiveness of all refinement modules. Proposed method achieves best registration results compared to competing keypoint/dense matching and refinement methods.

Conclusion: The proposed coarse-to-fine non-rigid registration method effectively automates multi-modal image alignment for art analysis, reducing manual labor while improving speed and precision through craquelure-based features and multi-level refinement.

Abstract: Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.

### [6] [Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces perspective tokens as specialized embeddings to enable multimodal language models to perform allocentric spatial reasoning and visual perspective-taking, overcoming their current egocentric bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning requiring adoption of another agent's visual perspective, showing persistent egocentric bias. The authors question whether current models support allocentric reasoning and aim to address this limitation.

Method: Introduce perspective tokens - specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. These tokens are integrated into LLaVA-1.5-13B model to enable level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks.

Result: Perspective tokens improve accuracy across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench). Rotation-based tokens generalize to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses show fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in base models.

Conclusion: Embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning. MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

### [7] [VTFusion: A Vision-Text Multimodal Fusion Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16381)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yiheng Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTFusion is a vision-text multimodal framework for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection that addresses domain gaps and semantic misalignment between modalities through adaptive feature extractors and dedicated fusion modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods rely on pre-trained features from natural scenes, ignoring domain-specific semantics for industrial inspection. Current fusion strategies use superficial concatenation that fails to address semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, compromising robustness against cross-modal interference.

Method: Two core designs: 1) Adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities to learn task-specific representations and bridge domain gaps, augmented by synthetic anomaly generation; 2) Multimodal prediction fusion module with a fusion block for cross-modal information exchange and segmentation network for pixel-level anomaly maps.

Result: Achieved image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in 2-shot scenario on MVTec AD and VisA datasets. Also achieved AUPRO of 93.5% on real-world industrial automotive plastic parts dataset, demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance by effectively addressing domain gaps and semantic misalignment through adaptive multimodal fusion, proving effective for demanding industrial inspection scenarios.

Abstract: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.

### [8] [ResAgent: Entropy-based Prior Point Discovery and Visual Reasoning for Referring Expression Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394)
*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EBD-VBR is a novel Referring Expression Segmentation framework that improves point prompt selection through entropy-based discovery and vision-based reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RES methods using MLLMs have two key limitations: (1) coarse bounding boxes lead to redundant/non-discriminative point prompts, and (2) textual coordinate reasoning fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors.

Method: Proposes EBD-VBR framework with two components: Entropy-Based Point Discovery (EBD) that models spatial uncertainty to identify high-information points, and Vision-Based Reasoning (VBR) that verifies points through visual-semantic alignment instead of text-only coordinate inference. Uses coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization → entropy-guided point discovery → vision-based validation → mask decoding.

Result: Extensive evaluations on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks.

Conclusion: EBD-VBR effectively generates accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts by addressing key limitations of existing MLLM-based RES approaches.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

### [9] [A Cosine Network for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16413)
*Chunwei Tian,Chengyuan Zhang,Bob Zhang,Zhiwu Li,C. L. Philip Chen,David Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSRNet improves image super-resolution using heterogeneous blocks for complementary structural information and cosine annealing for training optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep CNNs can extract hierarchical structural information for image super-resolution, effectively preserving and utilizing this structural information remains challenging. The paper aims to address the limitations of homologous structural information and improve training optimization.

Method: Proposes CSRNet with two key innovations: 1) Odd and even heterogeneous blocks designed to extract complementary homologous structural information by enlarging architectural differences, and 2) Cosine annealing mechanism for training optimization that performs warm restarts and adjusts learning rates to overcome local minima in gradient descent.

Result: Experimental results show that CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CSRNet effectively combines linear and non-linear structural information to enhance robustness in image super-resolution, while the cosine annealing mechanism optimizes training, resulting in competitive performance with existing methods.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can use hierarchical information to progressively extract structural information to recover high-quality images. However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCCS-Det is a novel infrared small target detector that uses dual-stream saliency enhancement and latent-aware semantic extraction to improve target-background discrimination and feature representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) and feature redundancy/semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality).

Method: Proposes DCCS-Det with two key components: 1) Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block that integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation, and 2) Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module that uses cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling to mitigate feature degradation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation.

Conclusion: DCCS-Det effectively addresses the limitations of existing IRSTD methods by better modeling local-global features and reducing feature degradation, leading to superior performance in detecting small, low-contrast infrared targets.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

### [11] [AlphaFace: High Fidelity and Real-time Face Swapper Robust to Facial Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16429)
*Jongmin Yu,Hyeontaek Oh,Zhongtian Sun,Angelica I Aviles-Rivero,Moongu Jeon,Jinhong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaFace is a real-time face-swapping method that uses vision-language models and CLIP embeddings with contrastive losses to handle extreme facial poses while maintaining identity representation and attribute preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face-swapping methods degrade with extreme facial poses, geometric approaches add dependencies and computational cost, and diffusion-based methods are too slow for real-time use.

Method: Leverages open-source vision-language model and CLIP image/text embeddings with novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses for robust identity representation and attribute preservation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on pose-challenging cases across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF datasets while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: AlphaFace provides a practical solution for robust face-swapping in extreme poses with real-time capability, publicly available as open-source.

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on `https://github.com/andrewyu90/Alphaface_Official.git'.

*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Wuwei Wang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDAFNet improves infrared small target detection by addressing edge degradation and frequency interference issues through multi-scale edge enhancement and adaptive frequency processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods suffer from gradual degradation of target edge pixels as network depth increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate frequency components, causing low-frequency backgrounds to interfere with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise to trigger false detections.

Method: Proposes MDAFNet with two key modules: 1) Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module for edge extraction and enhancement to compensate for edge information loss during downsampling, and 2) Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module that combines frequency domain processing with simulated frequency decomposition/fusion in spatial domain to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets while suppressing noise.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate superior detection performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MDAFNet effectively addresses edge degradation and frequency interference problems in infrared small target detection through its innovative multi-scale edge and adaptive frequency processing modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates backbone networks for face recognition in post-pandemic masked scenarios, finding r100_mask_v2 performs best (90.07% accuracy) while traditional models excel without masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the post-pandemic era, high mask usage during civil aviation security checks creates significant challenges for traditional face recognition models, necessitating evaluation of backbone networks' performance in masked scenarios.

Method: Conducted extensive comparative experiments with multiple backbone networks (r100 series, r50, r34_mask_v1, r100_mask_v2, r50_mask_v3, Vit-Small/Tiny) under both standard and masked test conditions.

Result: Standard tests: r100 series excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR); r50 ranked second; r34_mask_v1 lagged. Masked tests: r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy); r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100; Vision Transformers showed strong masked performance with effectiveness gains.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive evaluation revealing model impacts on face recognition with/without masks, offering specific deployment recommendations for different scenarios, with r100_mask_v2 recommended for masked environments.

Abstract: Erratum to the paper (Zhang et al., 2025): corrections to Table IV and the data in Page 3, Section A. In the post-pandemic era, a high proportion of civil aviation passengers wear masks during security checks, posing significant challenges to traditional face recognition models. The backbone network serves as the core component of face recognition models. In standard tests, r100 series models excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR in face comparison, high top1/top5 in search). r50 ranked second, r34_mask_v1 lagged. In masked tests, r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy), r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100. Vit-Small/Tiny showed strong masked performance with gains in effectiveness. Through extensive comparative experiments, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of several core backbone networks, aiming to reveal the impacts of different models on face recognition with and without masks, and provide specific deployment recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited emotional reasoning capabilities due to scarcity of high-quality emotion datasets, lack of standardized benchmarks, and limitations of previous frameworks that relied on explicit face detectors and implicit fusion strategies.

Result: Created MMEVerse with 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks, establishing a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning.

Conclusion: Emotion-LLaMAv2 and MMEVerse provide a comprehensive solution for multimodal emotion reasoning, addressing previous limitations through architectural improvements and large-scale standardized benchmarking.

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA-PATH is an interactive pathology segmentation foundation model that combines visual context, semantic descriptions, and expert spatial prompts for precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous tissue structures, outperforming existing models and enabling clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation foundation models treat segmentation as static visual prediction tasks, lacking alignment with pathology needs. They fail to handle heterogeneous tissue structures, incorporate expert feedback, or produce clinically meaningful pixel-level segmentations.

Method: VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts. The model is trained on VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale corpus of 1.6M image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes.

Result: VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models across held-out and external benchmarks. It enables dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement and improves tissue microenvironment analysis through a proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS) that shows strong associations with patient survival.

Conclusion: VISTA-PATH elevates pathology image segmentation from static prediction to interactive, clinically grounded representation, establishing itself as a preferred foundation model for computational pathology with demonstrated clinical relevance.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using gameplay video glitches (visual anomalies violating physical laws) as scalable supervision for physical world understanding, creating PhysGame dataset and GameBench benchmark, showing improved physical reasoning in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack human-level physical understanding. Existing datasets are either expensive (real videos) or unrealistic (synthetic). Gameplay glitches offer rich, scalable supervision for physical reasoning.

Method: Leverage gameplay video glitches as supervision source. Create PhysGame dataset (140K QA pairs across 5 domains) using metadata-guided prompting. Build GameBench benchmark (880 expert-annotated videos) for evaluation.

Result: PhysGame improves Game2Real transfer (+2.5% on PhysBench), Game2General transfer (+1.9% on MVBench), and GameBench performance (+3.7%). Shows gameplay anomalies are effective for physical reasoning.

Conclusion: Learning from gameplay glitches provides scalable, effective pathway for advancing physical world understanding in multimodal AI, addressing limitations of current datasets while maintaining realism.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wound care faces economic/logistical burdens globally. Computer vision can help with automatic tissue assessment via wound segmentation. While 2D segmentation exists, 3D segmentation enables more complete healing tracking, but multi-view consistent 3D reconstruction from 2D images remains challenging.

Method: WoundNeRF - a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. Uses neural radiance fields with signed distance functions for 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: WoundNeRF shows promise for 3D wound segmentation from 2D images. Code will be released to facilitate further development in this paradigm.

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EKDC-Net introduces an expert knowledge-guided framework for fine-grained tree species classification that addresses long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity by extracting discriminative features via CAM analysis and dynamically calibrating decisions based on uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tree species classification methods focus on complex architectures but overlook long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity in limited data, struggling with few-shot or confusing categories. Inspired by human knowledge dissemination where individuals seek expert help, the authors propose leveraging external domain expertise.

Method: Proposes Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) with two modules: 1) Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM) uses CAM analysis to guide domain expert to focus on discriminative features; 2) Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM) dynamically corrects local model decisions based on overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Also introduces CU-Tree102 dataset with 102 tree species.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets. As a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters.

Conclusion: EKDC-Net effectively addresses challenges in fine-grained tree species classification by incorporating expert knowledge and uncertainty-based calibration, demonstrating significant performance improvements with minimal parameter overhead. The new CU-Tree102 dataset addresses diversity limitations in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate fine-grained tree species classification is critical for forest inventory and biodiversity monitoring. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external "Domain Expert" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters.

TL;DR: SALAD introduces a lightweight linear attention branch with input-dependent gating to achieve 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup for diffusion transformers in video generation while maintaining quality comparable to full attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers for video generation suffer from high computational latency due to quadratic complexity of full attention on long sequences. Existing sparse attention methods have limitations: training-free approaches offer modest acceleration with limited sparsity, while training-based methods require substantial data and computation.

Method: SALAD (Sparse Attention with Linear Attention Branch) introduces a lightweight linear attention branch parallel to sparse attention, with an input-dependent gating mechanism to balance the two branches. This enables high sparsity (90%) while maintaining quality.

Result: Achieves 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup while maintaining generation quality comparable to full attention baseline. The finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with batch size of 8.

Conclusion: SALAD provides an efficient solution to the computational bottleneck in diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant speedup with minimal training requirements while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

TL;DR: TangramPuzzle benchmark evaluates MLLMs' compositional spatial reasoning using Tangram game geometry with precise coordinate specifications, revealing models prioritize silhouette matching over geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show remarkable visual recognition but lack precise compositional spatial reasoning. Existing benchmarks use simple tasks with semantic approximations and lack rigorous mathematical formulations, creating a gap in evaluating true geometric reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces TangramPuzzle benchmark with Tangram Construction Expression (TCE) - a symbolic geometric framework using exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications. Designs two tasks: Outline Prediction (inferring global shapes from local components) and End-to-End Code Generation (solving inverse geometric assembly problems).

Result: Extensive evaluation of advanced open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals they tend to prioritize matching target silhouettes while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of pieces.

Conclusion: The TangramPuzzle benchmark successfully exposes limitations in MLLMs' compositional spatial reasoning, showing they rely on visual approximations rather than precise geometric understanding, highlighting need for improved geometric reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view 360° scene generation is crucial for real-world applications but remains highly ill-posed. Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting full-scene generation quality.

Method: Proposes AnchoredDream with appearance-geometry mutual boosting: 1) appearance-guided geometry generation for reliable 3D layout, 2) progressive scene generation through warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization modules, and 3) novel Grouting Block for seamless transitions between input and generated regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility, achieving high-quality results in a zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation, addressing key limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

Motivation: Existing MLLM methods lack continuous spatial understanding in changing environments and cannot be deployed on real-world embodied systems.

Method: Proposes OnlineSI framework with finite spatial memory to retain past observations without increasing computation, and integrates 3D point clouds with semantic information.

Result: Method evaluated with Fuzzy F1-Score to handle ambiguity, tested on two datasets, showing effectiveness for real-world embodied systems.

Conclusion: OnlineSI enables continuous spatial understanding from video streams, paving the way for deployment on real-world embodied systems.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

Motivation: To extend hierarchical open-set classification to semi-supervised setting, enabling use of large-scale uncurated datasets containing both known and unknown classes to improve performance.

Method: Proposed teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling with two key components: 1) subtree pseudo-labels for reliable supervision with unknown data, and 2) age-gating mechanism to mitigate pseudo-label overconfidence.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables semi-supervised hierarchical open-set classification, making efficient use of uncurated mixed-class datasets while maintaining strong performance with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HA2F is a hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework for remote sensing change detection that addresses cross-temporal feature matching deviations and noise sensitivity through dual modules: DHFCM for dynamic hierarchical feature calibration and NAFRM for noise-adaptive feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RSCD methods have limitations: patch-based approaches focus on localized features while holistic methods process entire images, leading to cross-temporal feature matching deviations and sensitivity to radiometric/geometric noise. These issues hinder accurate change detection in remote sensing applications.

Method: HA2F framework consists of two modules: 1) Dynamic Hierarchical Feature Calibration Module (DHFCM) that fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection to suppress irrelevant discrepancies and address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. 2) Noise-Adaptive Feature Refinement Module (NAFRM) that uses dual feature selection to highlight change-sensitive regions, generate spatial masks, and suppress interference from irrelevant regions or shadows.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing methods in both precision metrics and computational efficiency. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of both DHFCM and NAFRM modules.

Conclusion: HA2F effectively addresses cross-temporal feature matching and noise sensitivity issues in remote sensing change detection through its dual-module hierarchical adaptive aggregation approach, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR frameworks fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage with only marginal gains over baselines, lacking effective multimodal representation alignment.

Method: Proposes CoVR framework with X-Aligner cross-attention module for progressive visual-textual fusion and alignment, incorporates visual query captions, uses two-stage training (first X-Aligner only, then fine-tune text encoder), built on BLIP-family architectures.

Result: Achieves SOTA Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIRCO and Fashion-IQ datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages VLMs for CoVR through progressive multimodal fusion and alignment, achieving superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR obtaining a Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks.

Conclusion: Provides practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical AI under resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Intelligent medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision support but is often limited by scarce annotations, constrained computational resources, and suboptimal model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability. Overall, this work provides a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical artificial intelligence under resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: BPIM framework improves small object detection in UAV imagery by integrating boundary, position, and scale information through attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in UAV applications faces challenges due to imbalanced scale and blurred edges, making accurate capture difficult.

Method: Proposes BPIM framework with five modules: PIG for location info, BIG for edge extraction, CSF for shallow feature assembly, TFF for combining position/boundary info, and AWF for deep feature fusion using attention mechanisms.

Result: BPIM outperforms baseline Yolov5-P2 on VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with comparable computation load.

Conclusion: BPIM effectively addresses small object detection challenges in UAV imagery by integrating boundary, position, and scale information through specialized modules and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

Abstract: The growing demand for diverse and high-quality facial datasets for training and testing biometric systems is challenged by privacy regulations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns. Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models. This research highlights the potential of SCHIGAND to supplement and, in some cases, replace real data for facial biometric applications, paving the way for privacy-compliant and scalable solutions in synthetic dataset generation.

Conclusion: The proposed SPL effectively addresses structural preservation challenges in LDM-based editing, offering improved performance while maintaining edit quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReWeaver: A framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images (as few as 4 views) that predicts seams, panels, and their connectivities in both 2D UV and 3D space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing garment reconstruction methods use unstructured representations (like 3D Gaussian Splats) that struggle with accurate garment topology and sewing structures, making them unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation needed in digital avatars, virtual try-on, and robotic manipulation applications.

Method: ReWeaver predicts seams and panels with their connectivities in both 2D UV space and 3D space from sparse multi-view RGB images. The framework is trained on GCD-TS, a large-scale dataset with over 100,000 synthetic samples containing multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes, and annotated sewing patterns covering complex geometries and topologies.

Result: ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in topology accuracy, geometry alignment, and seam-panel consistency. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with multi-view images, producing structured 2D-3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: ReWeaver provides a novel solution for topology-accurate garment reconstruction that bridges the sim-to-real gap by producing structured representations that maintain accurate sewing patterns and garment topology from minimal input views, enabling practical applications in digital fashion and robotics.

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

TL;DR: ACLNet introduces affinity contrastive learning for skeleton-based human activity understanding, using affinity metrics to form activity superclasses and dynamic temperature scheduling for better feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based activity understanding fail to exploit structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples, limiting feature discrimination.

Method: Proposes ACLNet with: 1) affinity metric to refine similarity measurements and form activity superclasses, 2) dynamic temperature schedule to adaptively adjust penalty strength for different superclasses, 3) margin-based contrastive strategy to improve separation of hard positive/negative samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate superiority in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

Conclusion: ACLNet effectively addresses limitations of existing contrastive learning approaches by exploiting structural inter-class relationships and handling anomalous samples, leading to improved feature discrimination across multiple skeleton-based activity understanding tasks.

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

*Sana Al-azzawi,Elisa Barney,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CER-HV framework improves Arabic-script HTR by detecting and cleaning label errors in datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic-script handwritten text recognition lags behind Latin-script HTR despite architectural advances, with data quality being a significant limiting factor in published datasets.

Method: CER-HV framework combines CER-based noise detector (using carefully configured CRNN with early stopping) and human-in-the-loop verification to detect label errors including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content issues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 8.45% CER on KHATT, 8.26% on PHTI, 10.66% on Ajami, 10.11% on Muharaf. CER-HV improves evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6% on cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8% on noisier ones. Detects errors with 80-90% precision.

Conclusion: Data quality is crucial for HTR performance, and CER-HV provides an effective framework for dataset cleaning that can be applied to various text recognition tasks beyond Arabic-script languages.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

*Yann Le Gall,Nicolas Burlet,Mathieu Simon,Fabien Novella,Samantha Dugelay,Jean-Philippe Malkasse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSAS provides 360° seabed imaging but loses shadow information valuable for target recognition. This paper proposes using sub-aperture filtering and FFSE to retrieve shadows from CSAS data for improved target analysis and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circular SAS provides superior 360° azimuth coverage but loses shadow information that is crucial for target recognition in mine warfare. Shadows provide complementary shape information that can reduce false alarms and aid in 3D reconstruction.

Method: 1) Sub-aperture filtering to obtain multiple images from different viewpoints along the circular trajectory; 2) Fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) to obtain sharp shadows; 3) Interactive visualization interface for human operators; 4) Space-carving reconstruction method to infer 3D shape from segmented shadows.

Result: The approach successfully retrieves shadow information from CSAS data, demonstrating the potential of shadows for improving target analysis and enabling 3D reconstruction of seabed objects.

Conclusion: Shadow information in circular SAS data can be effectively retrieved and utilized to enhance target recognition capabilities and enable 3D reconstruction, addressing a key limitation of conventional CSAS processing.

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

### [35] [A Step to Decouple Optimization in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16736)
*Renjie Ding,Yaonan Wang,Min Liu,Jialin Zhu,Jiazheng Wang,Jiahao Zhao,Wenting Shen,Feixiang He,Xiang Che*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes optimization issues in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), identifies coupling problems in gradient updates, proposes decoupled components, and introduces AdamW-GS for improved optimization efficiency and representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3DGS uses optimization techniques from deep neural networks (like Adam), there are overlooked coupling issues specific to 3DGS: update step coupling causing optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates, and gradient coupling in moments leading to ineffective regularization. These complex couplings are under-explored despite their impact on optimization efficiency.

Method: The authors revisit 3DGS optimization, decouple it into three components: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. They conduct extensive experiments under both 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, then re-design the optimization by re-coupling beneficial components to create AdamW-GS.

Result: Empirical analysis provides deeper understanding of optimization components. The proposed AdamW-GS achieves simultaneous improvements in both optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: By addressing coupling issues in 3DGS optimization through careful decoupling and re-coupling of components, the proposed AdamW-GS framework enables better optimization performance and representation quality, advancing the state of 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations are increasing stress on road pavements and maintenance costs, creating a need for targeted and efficient maintenance strategies for highway infrastructure.

Method: Integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization, then calculates a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index to inform nationwide maintenance.

Result: Crack classification achieved F1-scores of 0.84 (crack) and 0.97 (no crack). RHCD index showed weak correlations with temperature amplitudes (r=-0.05) and traffic volume (r=0.17), with high values near urban centers and intersections.

Conclusion: Open-source data sharing enables innovative solutions for public sector infrastructure maintenance, with the RHCD index providing valuable guidance beyond traditional temperature and traffic data.

Abstract: Highway networks are crucial for economic prosperity. Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations are exacerbating stress on road pavements, resulting in elevated maintenance costs. This underscores the need for targeted and efficient maintenance strategies. This study investigates the potential of open-source data to guide highway infrastructure maintenance. The proposed framework integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization. To demonstrate the framework's real-world applicability, a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index was calculated to inform nationwide highway maintenance. The crack classification model achieved an F1-score of $0.84$ for the positive class (crack) and $0.97$ for the negative class (no crack). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlations with Long-term Land Surface Temperature Amplitudes (LT-LST-A) (Pearson's $r\ = -0.05$) and Traffic Volume (TV) (Pearson's $r\ = 0.17$), underlining the added value of this novel index for guiding maintenance over other data. Significantly high RHCD values were observed near urban centers and intersections, providing contextual validation for the predictions. These findings highlight the value of open-source data sharing to drive innovation, ultimately enabling more efficient solutions in the public sector.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMPose: A probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method using flow matching generative approach to lift 2D poses to 3D with uncertainty modeling, outperforming diffusion-based methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human pose estimation from monocular views is ill-posed due to depth ambiguity. Existing methods often produce incorrect but overconfident 3D estimates. Probabilistic approaches that model uncertainty are needed to address this problem.

Method: FMPose uses flow matching generative approach with optimal transport to learn mapping from simple source distribution to plausible 3D pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. 2D cues are conditioned using graph convolutional networks that leverage learnable connections between body joints as graph structure for feature aggregation.

Result: FMPose achieves major improvements over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Compared to diffusion-based methods, it produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations.

Conclusion: Flow matching with optimal transport is an effective approach for probabilistic 3D human pose estimation, offering better speed and accuracy than diffusion-based methods while properly handling uncertainty in the ill-posed 2D-to-3D lifting problem.

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepARG is the first method to encode B-rep geometry and topology into holistic token sequences for autoregressive generation using transformers, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous graph-based B-rep approaches decouple geometry and topology, preventing the use of sequence-based generative frameworks like transformers that have shown remarkable performance.

Method: Encodes B-rep into three token types: geometry, position, and face index tokens. Constructs hierarchical token sequences starting with geometry blocks (faces/edges), then sequences them, and assembles holistic sequence representation. Uses transformer-based autoregressive model with decoder-only architecture and causal masking for next-token prediction.

Result: BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in B-rep generation experiments.

Conclusion: Validates feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation with sequence-based approaches.

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASP introduces CLS token attention steering prompts with bias parameters to modulate self-attention weights, plus attention perturbation and token mixup, achieving SOTA FSCIL performance with minimal parameters and no incremental fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot class-incremental learning faces challenges in adapting to new classes with limited samples while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Existing prompt-based methods need better transfer and generalization capabilities, especially in extreme few-shot settings where leveraging pretrained knowledge to learn shareable feature representations is crucial.

Method: Proposes CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP) with class-shared trainable bias parameters in CLS token's query, key, and value projections to modulate self-attention weights. Also includes attention perturbation strategy and Manifold Token Mixup in shallow feature space to synthesize potential new class features for better generalization and representation capacity reservation.

Result: Experiments on CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets show CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings, without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and with significantly reduced parameter overhead.

Conclusion: CASP effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by steering CLS token attention with bias parameters and enhancing generalization through attention perturbation and token mixup, achieving superior performance with minimal parameters and no incremental fine-tuning requirements.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

Motivation: Current automated detection methods for spinal ligament landmarks are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy, while precise identification of these landmarks is crucial for realistic biomechanical modeling of spine forces.

Method: Two-stage approach: first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae, then applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of ligament attachment points.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm on two independent spinal datasets, demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable, accurate, and generalizable solution for automated detection of spinal ligament landmarks, enabling more realistic biomechanical modeling of spine forces.

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

*Xuewei Li,Xinghan Bao,Zhimin Chen,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REL-SF4PASS: A panoramic semantic segmentation method using novel REL depth representation in cylindrical coordinates and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion (SMMF) to better utilize panoramic geometry and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PASS methods don't fully utilize panoramic image geometry - they focus on spherical geometry with RGB or use depth in original/HHA format. There's a need for better geometric representation and fusion strategies for panoramic images.

Method: Proposes REL depth representation (Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, Lateral Orientation Angle) in cylindrical coordinates, and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion (SMMF) that uses different fusion strategies for different panoramic regions to reduce ERP projection artifacts.

Result: Achieves 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds of Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets and reduces performance variance by ~70% when facing 3D disturbances, showing improved robustness.

Conclusion: REL-SF4PASS effectively addresses panoramic geometry utilization through cylindrical coordinate representation and adaptive multi-modal fusion, significantly improving PASS performance and robustness.

Abstract: As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) aims to give complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance.

### [43] [Incorporating Eye-Tracking Signals Into Multimodal Deep Visual Models For Predicting User Aesthetic Experience In Residential Interiors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16811)
*Chen-Ying Chien,Po-Chih Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework fuses visual features with eye-tracking data to predict aesthetic evaluations of interior spaces, achieving 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions and 66.8% on subjective dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting aesthetic experiences in interior design is challenging due to subjective perception and complex visual responses. Current methods struggle to capture how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces for well-being promotion.

Method: Developed a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that combines visual features from interior design videos with synchronized eye-tracking signals (gaze data and pupil responses). Collected dataset of 224 interior design videos with gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions.

Result: Model achieved 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines. Eye-tracking trained models maintain comparable performance with visual input alone. Pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while gaze+visual combination enhances subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking serves as valuable privileged information during training, enabling more practical aesthetic assessment tools for interior design. The approach demonstrates that multimodal fusion of visual and physiological signals improves prediction of aesthetic experiences.

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

*Chenxi Ruan,Yu Xiao,Yihan Hou,Guosheng Hu,Wei Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorConceptBench is a new benchmark to evaluate how text-to-image models associate colors with implicit concepts, revealing current models lack sensitivity to abstract color semantics despite scaling and guidance interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models have advanced significantly, but their ability to associate colors with implicit concepts (beyond explicit color names/codes) remains underexplored and poorly understood.

Method: Created ColorConceptBench - a human-annotated benchmark with 1,281 implicit color concepts and 6,369 human annotations to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through probabilistic color distributions.

Result: Evaluation of seven leading T2I models shows they lack sensitivity to abstract color semantics, and this limitation persists despite standard interventions like model scaling and guidance techniques.

Conclusion: Achieving human-like color semantics requires more than just larger models - it demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

### [45] [No Validation, No Problem: Predicting Model Performance from a Single Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16874)
*Fangzheng Wu,Brian Summa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a validation-free checkpoint selection method using the Frobenius norm of classifier-head gradients from a single forward-backward pass, which strongly correlates with model performance across various architectures and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional checkpoint selection requires validation data and labels, which can be expensive and privacy-sensitive. The paper aims to develop a lightweight, label-free method for checkpoint selection and monitoring that doesn't require validation data.

Method: Uses the Frobenius norm of classifier-head gradients (||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F) from one detached-feature batch as a proxy for model performance. Implements head-scale normalization for classic CNNs and feature-scale normalization for Transformers/modern CNNs. Applies tail-window selection to pick checkpoints with minimum gradient norm.

Result: The gradient norm proxy shows strong negative correlation with Top-1 accuracy and positive correlation with loss. It closes most of the gap to oracle selection (4.24% ± 2.00% with universal setup, ~1.12% with per-family tuning). Also works for COCO detection/segmentation and diffusion models, tracking progress and enabling near-oracle selection.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient norm probe provides an effective, lightweight, label-free alternative to validation-based checkpoint selection, adding minimal computational overhead (<0.1% of an epoch) and working across diverse architectures and tasks without requiring validation labels.

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

*Yangfan Xu,Lilian Zhang,Xiaofeng He,Pengdong Wu,Wenqi Wu,Jun Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised training framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers that eliminates need for ground truth labels by using sequence-wise geometric constraints and joint optimization of photometric and geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VGGT models require ground truth labels for training, which limits their adaptability to unlabeled and unseen scenes. There's a need for self-supervised approaches to enhance localization capability in large-scale environments without labeled data.

Method: Extends pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints by sampling multiple source frames and geometrically projecting them onto different target frames. Uses joint optimization loss combining physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints instead of hard labels.

Result: Model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Both local/global cross-view attention layers and camera/depth heads effectively capture underlying multi-view geometry.

Conclusion: Proposed self-supervised framework successfully trains VGGT models without ground truth labels, enhancing their adaptability to unlabeled scenes and improving large-scale localization performance through sequence-wise geometric constraints.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.

*Nakul Poudel,Richard Simon,Cristian A. Linte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong potential for surgical tool detection, with Qwen2.5 outperforming other VLMs and demonstrating competitive performance against specialized detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in surgery are mostly unimodal, limiting holistic understanding of surgical workflows. There's a need for general-purpose surgical AI systems that can comprehensively model interrelated surgical scene components. Large VLMs offer potential for multimodal data processing and human-like scene reasoning in surgical applications.

Method: Evaluated three state-of-the-art VLMs (Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, InternVL3.5) on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset for surgical tool detection. Tested both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Compared performance against open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO.

Result: Qwen2.5 consistently achieved superior detection performance among VLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Compared to Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 showed stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Qwen2.5 excelled at instrument recognition while Grounding DINO demonstrated stronger localization capabilities.

Conclusion: Large VLMs, particularly Qwen2.5, show promising capabilities for surgical vision tasks like tool detection, offering strong generalization and competitive performance compared to specialized detection models. This suggests VLMs could be valuable for developing more comprehensive surgical AI systems.

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies "sink-collapse" in long-form video generation where content repeatedly reverts to attention sink frames, proposes a training-free RoPE jitter method to fix it, and demonstrates 12-hour continuous video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive long-form video generation models suffer from error accumulation and loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames help, they create a new problem called "sink-collapse" where generated content repeatedly reverts to sink frames, causing abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, training-free approach using multi-head RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. This addresses the inherent conflict between RoPE's periodic structure and multi-head attention mechanisms.

Result: The method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. Achieves real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. Demonstrates continuous videos up to 12 hours in length - among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free RoPE jitter method effectively solves the sink-collapse problem in long-form video generation, enabling robust, high-quality, and extremely long video generation without the cyclic reset issues that plague current approaches.

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

*Jingran Zhang,Ning Li,Yuanhao Ban,Andrew Bai,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using reward signals instead of teacher models to guide autoregressive video generation, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while simplifying training and avoiding teacher architecture constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive video generation models rely heavily on teacher models, which limits performance when strong autoregressive teachers are unavailable, causing output quality to lag behind bidirectional models. The authors seek an alternative approach that doesn't depend on teacher architectures.

Method: The method uses reward signals to guide the autoregressive generation process, simplifying training while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. This approach avoids the constraints imposed by teacher model architectures.

Result: On VBench, the method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods (84.31) that require significant heterogeneous distillation. In some cases, it surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models.

Conclusion: Reward-guided autoregressive video generation provides an effective alternative to teacher-dependent approaches, achieving competitive performance while offering more efficient and scalable training without the limitations of teacher architectures.

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework for medical images that handles multiple unknown domain shifts without explicit domain labels, using copy-paste augmentation and cluster-based feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical image segmentation faces two key challenges: 1) scarcity of expert annotations, and 2) mixed-domain settings where images come from multiple scanners/centers with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing approaches assume either single domain shifts or require explicit domain indices, which don't match real-world deployment scenarios.

Method: Proposes a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework with two main components: 1) Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) that augments training data by transferring informative regions across domains to enhance data diversity, and 2) Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block that clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors using MMD objective to encourage domain-invariant representations. The method is integrated within a teacher-student framework.

Result: Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks show the approach consistently surpasses existing semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods. The method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation, addressing the practical challenges of scarce annotations and multiple unknown domain shifts in real-world medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern Vision-Language Models lack proper characterization in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. There's a need for systematic evaluation of VLMs in interactive settings.

Method: Created VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments spanning symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation. The suite provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. Also developed multi-step solvers to generate structured demonstrations for supervised finetuning.

Result: All frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates (46.6% easy, 26.0% hard). Key limitations: models struggle with long context (perform worse with unbounded history), and text-based symbolic tasks become harder when rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations yield consistent gains.

Conclusion: VisGym provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving VLMs in multi-step visual decision-making, revealing concrete failure modes and pathways for enhancement, particularly in handling long-horizon interactions and visual representations of symbolic tasks.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

TL;DR: SyncLight enables consistent parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views using a multi-view diffusion transformer trained with latent bridge matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view relighting methods fail to maintain lighting consistency across multiple views, which is essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production.

Method: Uses a multi-view diffusion transformer trained with latent bridge matching formulation, enabling precise control over light intensity and color across multi-view captures conditioned on a single reference edit.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity relighting of entire image sets in single inference, generalizes zero-shot to arbitrary number of viewpoints without camera pose information, and works on both synthetic and real-world multi-view captures.

Conclusion: SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems by providing consistent parametric relighting across uncalibrated views.

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models struggle with maintaining multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments, especially when viewpoints have minimal overlap.

Method: A diffusion-based framework trained on multiple data sources (2D monocular, 3D multi-view static, and 4D multi-view dynamic datasets) to learn a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation for zero-shot novel video generation from arbitrary camera trajectories.

Result: Competitive performance on standard benchmarks and superior results on the proposed AnyViewBench for extreme dynamic view synthesis, where baselines degrade significantly while AnyView maintains realistic, plausible, and consistent videos from any viewpoint.

Conclusion: AnyView demonstrates robust dynamic view synthesis capabilities with minimal geometric assumptions, effectively handling extreme viewpoint changes in diverse real-world scenarios where other methods fail.

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.
