*Chenye Meng,Zejian Li,Zhongni Liu,Yize Li,Changle Xie,Kaixin Jia,Ling Yang,Huanghuang Deng,Shiying Ding,Shengyuan Zhang,Jiayi Li,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Complex Preference Optimization (CPO), a two-stage alignment framework that enables diffusion models to align with hierarchical, fine-grained human expertise rather than simplified binary preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training alignment of diffusion models relies on oversimplified signals (scalar rewards or binary preferences), which limits alignment with complex human expertise that is hierarchical and fine-grained.

Method: 1. Construct hierarchical fine-grained evaluation criteria with domain experts (tree structure of positive/negative attributes). 2. Two-stage alignment: First, inject domain knowledge to auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align target diffusion with non-binary hierarchical criteria by maximizing positive attributes and minimizing negative attributes.

Result: Extensive experiments in painting generation domain show CPO significantly enhances generation quality and alignment with expertise, opening new avenues for fine-grained criteria alignment.

Conclusion: CPO successfully addresses the limitation of simplified alignment signals by enabling diffusion models to align with complex hierarchical human expertise, demonstrating improved generation quality in specialized domains like painting generation.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of diffusion models relies on simplified signals, such as scalar rewards or binary preferences. This limits alignment with complex human expertise, which is hierarchical and fine-grained. To address this, we first construct a hierarchical, fine-grained evaluation criteria with domain experts, which decomposes image quality into multiple positive and negative attributes organized in a tree structure. Building on this, we propose a two-stage alignment framework. First, we inject domain knowledge to an auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, we introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align the target diffusion to our non-binary, hierarchical criteria. Specifically, we reformulate the alignment problem to simultaneously maximize the probability of positive attributes while minimizing the probability of negative attributes with the auxiliary diffusion. We instantiate our approach in the domain of painting generation and conduct CPO training with an annotated dataset of painting with fine-grained attributes based on our criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPO significantly enhances generation quality and alignment with expertise, opening new avenues for fine-grained criteria alignment.

### [2] [Embedding Textual Information in Images Using Quinary Pixel Combinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04302)
*A V Uday Kiran Kandala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel text embedding in images using quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, achieving single-pixel encoding with minimal distortion and improved efficiency over traditional LSB/MSB methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text embedding methods (LSB, MSB, PVD, transform domain, deep learning) often require multiple pixels, cause noise/distortion, are computationally heavy, or have deterministic encoding/decoding. Need for more efficient, less distorting single-pixel encoding.

Method: Uses quinary combinations of pixel intensities in RGB space - five controlled intensity variations in each R, G, B channel create 125 distinct combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols (letters, numbers, whitespace, special characters).

Result: Achieves complete textual symbol encoding within single RGB pixel. Metrics (MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram, Heatmap) show no significant distortion. Improved embedding efficiency compared to multi-pixel LSB/MSB and computationally heavy deep learning methods.

Conclusion: Proposed quinary pixel intensity method provides efficient, low-distortion text embedding in images with single-pixel encoding capability, outperforming traditional approaches in embedding efficiency and computational requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for embedding textual data into images using quinary combinations of pixel intensities in RGB space. Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images. Furthermore, the method achieves improved embedding efficiency by encoding a complete textual symbol within a single RGB pixel, in contrast to LSB and MSB based approaches that typically require multiple pixels or multi-step processes, as well as transform and learning based methods that incur higher computational overhead.

*Jiahui Chen,Philippe Hansen-Estruch,Xiaochuang Han,Yushi Hu,Emily Dinan,Amita Kamath,Michal Drozdzal,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Luke Zettlemoyer,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified multimodal generation architecture that enables autonomous text-to-image synthesis within a single inference process, using reward-weighted post-training with self-generated synthetic data to improve performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified multimodal generation systems rely on explicit modality switching (generating reasoning text first, then manually switching to image generation), which limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. The authors aim to achieve fully unified text-image generation where models can autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis.

Method: The paper explores post-training to achieve unified text-image generation, examining different post-training data strategies. They use offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, specifically investigating the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training.

Result: The approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks. The authors show that targeted datasets addressing specific limitations achieve superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.

Conclusion: Fully unified text-image generation through post-training with reward-weighted synthetic data is effective for improving multimodal image generation, with strategic data design being more important than broad corpora for achieving superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal generation architectures that jointly produce text and images have recently emerged as a promising direction for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, many existing systems rely on explicit modality switching, generating reasoning text before switching manually to image generation. This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.

### [4] [ReHyAt: Recurrent Hybrid Attention for Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04342)
*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReHyAt introduces a recurrent hybrid attention mechanism combining softmax and linear attention for efficient video diffusion models, reducing training costs by 99% while maintaining state-of-the-art quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models use transformer architectures with quadratic attention complexity, which severely limits scalability for longer video sequences and makes them impractical for long-duration or on-device generation.

Method: ReHyAt uses a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines softmax attention fidelity with linear attention efficiency, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation with constant memory usage. It employs efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models through a lightweight pipeline.

Result: ReHyAt reduces training cost by two orders of magnitude (~160 GPU hours vs. typical ~16k hours), achieves state-of-the-art video quality on VBench and VBench-2.0, and reduces attention cost from quadratic to linear while maintaining competitive quality.

Conclusion: ReHyAt provides a practical solution for scalable long-duration and on-device video generation by combining efficiency and quality, with a distillation pipeline that can be applied to future bidirectional softmax-based models.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have shifted towards transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art video generation but at the cost of quadratic attention complexity, which severely limits scalability for longer sequences. We introduce ReHyAt, a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines the fidelity of softmax attention with the efficiency of linear attention, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage. Unlike the concurrent linear-only SANA Video, ReHyAt's hybrid design allows efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models, reducing the training cost by two orders of magnitude to ~160 GPU hours, while being competitive in the quality. Our light-weight distillation and finetuning pipeline provides a recipe that can be applied to future state-of-the-art bidirectional softmax-based models. Experiments on VBench and VBench-2.0, as well as a human preference study, demonstrate that ReHyAt achieves state-of-the-art video quality while reducing attention cost from quadratic to linear, unlocking practical scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation.

### [5] [SCAR-GS: Spatial Context Attention for Residuals in Progressive Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04348)
*Diego Revilla,Pooja Suresh,Anand Bhojan,Ooi Wei Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive 3D Gaussian Splatting compression using Residual Vector Quantization with auto-regressive entropy model guided by multi-resolution hash grid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting models have large storage requirements that hinder cloud/streaming deployment. Existing progressive compression methods using scalar quantization don't optimally capture high-dimensional feature correlations, limiting rate-distortion performance.

Method: Replace traditional methods with Residual Vector Quantization to compress primitive features. Use auto-regressive entropy model guided by multi-resolution hash grid to predict conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, enabling efficient compression of coarse and refinement layers.

Result: Not specified in abstract (paper likely shows improved compression efficiency and rate-distortion performance compared to existing methods).

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides more efficient progressive compression for 3D Gaussian Splatting models, addressing storage limitations for cloud/streaming deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have allowed for real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services. Some of the most recent progressive compression techniques for these models rely on progressive masking and scalar quantization techniques to reduce the bitrate of Gaussian attributes using spatial context models. While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.
  In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features. Our key contribution is an auto-regressive entropy model, guided by a multi-resolution hash grid, that accurately predicts the conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, allowing for coarse and refinement layers to be compressed with high efficiency.

### [7] [PackCache: A Training-Free Acceleration Method for Unified Autoregressive Video Generation via Compact KV-Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04359)
*Kunyang Li,Mubarak Shah,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PackCache: A training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts KV cache for unified autoregressive video generation, achieving 1.7-2.2x acceleration on 48-frame sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV-cache size grows linearly with generated tokens in unified autoregressive models, becoming the dominant bottleneck for inference efficiency and generative length, especially problematic for video generation.

Method: PackCache uses three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring (preserves semantic references), cross-frame decay modeling (allocates cache budget by temporal distance), and spatially preserving position embedding (maintains 3D structure under cache removal).

Result: 1.7-2.2x acceleration on 48-frame sequences; final four frames see 2.6x (A40) and 3.7x (H200) acceleration; enables longer-sequence video generation.

Conclusion: PackCache effectively addresses KV-cache bottleneck in unified autoregressive video generation through spatiotemporal-aware compression, significantly improving inference efficiency without training.

Abstract: A unified autoregressive model is a Transformer-based framework that addresses diverse multimodal tasks (e.g., text, image, video) as a single sequence modeling problem under a shared token space. Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.

*Paraskevi Valergaki,Vassilis C. Nicodemou,Iason Oikonomidis,Antonis Argyros,Anastasios Roussos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D facial geometry from EMOCA reveals stress patterns comparable to physiological signals; Transformer with cross-modal attention achieves best stress recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress recognition from facial videos is challenging due to subjective nature and voluntary facial control. Existing methods rely on Facial Action Units, but disentangled 3D facial geometry remains underexplored for stress analysis.

Method: Analyzed stress during distracted driving using EMOCA-derived 3D expression and pose coefficients. Used paired hypothesis tests between baseline and stressor phases. Proposed Transformer-based temporal modeling framework with unimodal, early-fusion, and cross-modal attention strategies for stress recognition.

Result: 41 of 56 EMOCA coefficients showed consistent, phase-specific stress responses comparable to physiological markers. Cross-Modal Attention fusion of EMOCA and physiological signals achieved best performance (AUROC 92%, Accuracy 86.7%). EMOCA-gaze fusion also performed well (AUROC 91.8%).

Conclusion: Disentangled 3D facial geometry is effective for stress recognition. Temporal modeling with cross-modal attention significantly improves performance, highlighting the value of combining facial and physiological signals for reliable stress detection.

Abstract: Reliable stress recognition from facial videos is challenging due to stress's subjective nature and voluntary facial control. While most methods rely on Facial Action Units, the role of disentangled 3D facial geometry remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing stress during distracted driving using EMOCA-derived 3D expression and pose coefficients. Paired hypothesis tests between baseline and stressor phases reveal that 41 of 56 coefficients show consistent, phase-specific stress responses comparable to physiological markers. Building on this, we propose a Transformer-based temporal modeling framework and assess unimodal, early-fusion, and cross-modal attention strategies. Cross-Modal Attention fusion of EMOCA and physiological signals achieves best performance (AUROC 92\%, Accuracy 86.7\%), with EMOCA-gaze fusion also competitive (AUROC 91.8\%).

### [9] [Few-Shot LoRA Adaptation of a Flow-Matching Foundation Model for Cross-Spectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04381)
*Maxim Clouser,Kia Khezeli,John Kalantari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained on RGB can be adapted with few-shot LoRA to translate RGB to IR/SAR, enabling synthetic data generation that improves downstream object detection in non-visible modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many safety-critical applications use non-visible modalities like IR and SAR, but foundation models are primarily trained on RGB. There's a need to repurpose RGB-trained models for cross-spectral translation with minimal paired data.

Method: Start with FLUX.1 Kontext foundation model, insert LoRA modules, and fine-tune on just 100 paired images per domain (RGB→IR on KAIST, RGB→SAR on M4-SAR). Use LPIPS on 50 held-out pairs as proxy for downstream performance to select best LoRA hyperparameters.

Result: Lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on IR/SAR and DETR on KAIST IR. Synthetic IR from external RGB datasets improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR.

Conclusion: Few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising approach for foundation-style support of non-visible modalities, enabling effective cross-spectral translation and synthetic data generation for downstream detection tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models for vision are predominantly trained on RGB data, while many safety-critical applications rely on non-visible modalities such as infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.

Pre-trained models excel in accuracy and speed, especially with limited data, while custom CNNs offer efficiency advantages. The findings provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate CNN architectures based on specific application requirements and resource constraints.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in image classification tasks; however, the choice between designing a custom CNN from scratch and employing established pre-trained architectures remains an important practical consideration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves cochlear implant surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances outcomes, but limited deep-learning studies exist due to challenges in acquiring ground-truth labels.

Method: Proposes a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework that predicts mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans where mastoid remains intact, leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging.

Result: Achieves mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance.

Conclusion: First work integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, providing groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from preoperative CT scans, offering robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning.

Abstract: Cochlear Implant (CI) surgery treats severe hearing loss by inserting an electrode array into the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve. An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans. To our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, offering a robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning while leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging.

*Donghang Lyu,Marius Staring,Hildo Lamb,Mariya Doneva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRUNet-MR-Univ is a foundation model for Cardiac MRI reconstruction that uses spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to handle diverse CMR scenarios, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for Cardiac MRI reconstruction lack generalizability across diverse CMR scenarios with variations in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types. Most models only handle narrow subsets of these variations, leading to performance degradation with distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that leverages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across a wide range of settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and promise.

Conclusion: CRUNet-MR-Univ represents a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios, addressing the generalizability limitations of current deep learning methods in Cardiac MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has attracted increasing attention in the field of Cardiac MRI (CMR) reconstruction due to its superior performance over traditional methods, particularly in handling higher acceleration factors, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications. However, current deep learning methods remain limited in generalizability. CMR scans exhibit wide variability in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types. Most existing models are designed to handle only a single or narrow subset of these variations, leading to performance degradation when faced with distribution shifts. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios. To this end, we propose CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that leverages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans. Our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across a wide range of settings, highlighting its effectiveness and promise.

TL;DR: GPRO is a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation between fast, perception, and reasoning paths to address overthinking in LVLMs by fixing visual perception failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chain-of-thought approaches in LVLMs cause overthinking - excessively verbose responses for simple queries leading to inefficiency and degraded accuracy. Prior work overlooks visual perception failures as a fundamental bottleneck, where reasoning errors often stem from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation.

Method: Proposes Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three paths at each generation step: 1) lightweight fast path, 2) slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and 3) slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. Uses teacher models to derive failure attribution supervision from ~790k samples to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors, then trains controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize accuracy vs. computational cost trade-off.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.

Conclusion: Stable reasoning in LVLMs critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and addressing visual perception failures through dynamic computation routing can significantly improve both accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought mechanisms that generate step-by-step rationales. However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniDrive-WM is a unified vision-language model world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and future image generation in a single architecture, outperforming previous methods on autonomous driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules, lacking integration. The authors aim to create a unified world model that tightly couples these components using vision-language models for better driving performance.

Method: UniDrive-WM uses a single VLM-based architecture that: 1) performs driving-scene understanding, 2) predicts future trajectories, and 3) generates trajectory-conditioned future images. The predicted trajectory conditions a VLM-based image generator, creating a feedback loop where future predictions enhance scene understanding and refine trajectory generation. The authors also compare discrete vs. continuous output representations for future image prediction.

Result: On the Bench2Drive benchmark, UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over previous best methods. The unified approach demonstrates superior performance compared to modular systems.

Conclusion: Tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling in a unified architecture provides significant advantages for autonomous driving, enabling better scene understanding, more accurate trajectory planning, and improved safety metrics.

Abstract: World models have become central to autonomous driving, where accurate scene understanding and future prediction are crucial for safe control. Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in integrating LLMs with vision-language models for remote sensing image change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics where accurate pixel-level change detection and semantic change captioning are challenging.

Method: Proposes an LLM-driven agent with multi-level change interpretation vision-language backbone and LLM-based orchestration, supporting natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. Introduces Forest-Change dataset with bi-temporal satellite imagery, change masks, and multi-granularity semantic captions.

Result: Achieves mIoU of 67.10% and BLEU-4 of 40.17% on Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% mIoU and 34.41% BLEU-4 on LEVIR-MCI-Trees benchmark, demonstrating strong performance for joint change detection and captioning.

Conclusion: LLM-driven RSICI systems show potential to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis, with publicly available data and code for further research.

Abstract: Modern forest monitoring workflows increasingly benefit from the growing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in deep learning. Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning. These results highlight the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSeg: A boundary-aware sparse token framework for efficient 3D medical segmentation that reduces computation by 64-68% while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical segmentation is computationally expensive due to cubic voxel growth and redundant processing of homogeneous regions. Need efficient methods that maintain accuracy while reducing resource requirements.

Method: Three main components: 1) Multi-scale hierarchical encoder extracts 400 candidate tokens across four resolutions; 2) Boundary-aware tokenizer uses VQ-VAE quantization with importance scoring to select 100 salient tokens (60% near boundaries); 3) Sparse-to-dense decoder reconstructs full masks via token reprojection, upsampling, and skip connections.

Result: Achieves 94.49% Dice and 89.61% IoU on 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset (960 cases), with 64% GPU memory reduction and 68% inference latency reduction. Generalizes well to MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmarks.

Conclusion: TokenSeg demonstrates anatomically informed sparse representation enables accurate and efficient 3D medical segmentation, balancing computational efficiency with boundary-aware precision.

Abstract: Three-dimensional medical image segmentation is a fundamental yet computationally demanding task due to the cubic growth of voxel processing and the redundant computation on homogeneous regions. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TokenSeg}, a boundary-aware sparse token representation framework for efficient 3D medical volume segmentation. Specifically, (1) we design a \emph{multi-scale hierarchical encoder} that extracts 400 candidate tokens across four resolution levels to capture both global anatomical context and fine boundary details; (2) we introduce a \emph{boundary-aware tokenizer} that combines VQ-VAE quantization with importance scoring to select 100 salient tokens, over 60\% of which lie near tumor boundaries; and (3) we develop a \emph{sparse-to-dense decoder} that reconstructs full-resolution masks through token reprojection, progressive upsampling, and skip connections. Extensive experiments on a 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset comprising 960 cases demonstrate that TokenSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.49\% Dice and 89.61\% IoU, while reducing GPU memory and inference latency by 64\% and 68\%, respectively. To verify the generalization capability, our evaluations on MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that TokenSeg consistently delivers optimal performance across heterogeneous anatomical structures. These results highlight the effectiveness of anatomically informed sparse representation for accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation.

### [18] [FaceRefiner: High-Fidelity Facial Texture Refinement with Differentiable Rendering-based Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04520)
*Chengyang Li,Baoping Cheng,Yao Cheng,Haocheng Zhang,Renshuai Liu,Yinglin Zheng,Jing Liao,Xuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceRefiner is a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method that improves texture quality and identity preservation by transferring multi-level information from input images to generated textures through differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial texture generation methods use deep networks to synthesize textures and fill UV maps, but these textures come from training data or 2D face generator spaces, limiting generalization for in-the-wild images. This leads to inconsistencies in facial details, structures, and identity with the input.

Method: FaceRefiner treats 3D sampled texture as style and texture generation output as content, using style transfer with differentiable rendering to transfer multi-level information (high, middle, and low/pixel level) from style to content, particularly preserving visible face region details.

Result: Extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets show that FaceRefiner improves texture quality and face identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed style transfer-based refinement method effectively addresses generalization limitations of current facial texture generation by preserving input details, structures, and semantics through multi-level information transfer with differentiable rendering.

Abstract: Recent facial texture generation methods prefer to use deep networks to synthesize image content and then fill in the UV map, thus generating a compelling full texture from a single image. Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts.

*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Junjie Wang,Yuekai Huang,Jie Huang,Zhiyuan Chang,Zhaoyang Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepMD is a harmful meme detection method that identifies invariant design concepts behind shifting memes, using Design Concept Graphs to guide MLLM detection with 81.1% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful memes constantly evolve in type and over time, making detection difficult. However, different harmful memes share underlying invariant design principles used by malicious creators, which could provide a stable basis for detection despite surface-level changes.

Method: 1) Define Design Concept Graph (DCG) based on attack trees to describe steps for designing harmful memes; 2) Derive DCG from historical memes using design step reproduction and graph pruning; 3) Use DCG to guide Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for harmful meme detection.

Result: RepMD achieves 81.1% accuracy (highest among compared methods), maintains good performance on type-shifting and temporal-evolving memes with only slight accuracy decreases, and improves human detection efficiency to 15-30 seconds per meme in human evaluation.

Conclusion: Focusing on invariant design concepts rather than shifting meme content provides an effective approach for detecting harmful memes, with RepMD demonstrating strong performance, generalization capability, and practical utility for human moderators.

Abstract: Harmful memes are ever-shifting in the Internet communities, which are difficult to analyze due to their type-shifting and temporal-evolving nature. Although these memes are shifting, we find that different memes may share invariant principles, i.e., the underlying design concept of malicious users, which can help us analyze why these memes are harmful. In this paper, we propose RepMD, an ever-shifting harmful meme detection method based on the design concept reproduction. We first refer to the attack tree to define the Design Concept Graph (DCG), which describes steps that people may take to design a harmful meme. Then, we derive the DCG from historical memes with design step reproduction and graph pruning. Finally, we use DCG to guide the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to detect harmful memes. The evaluation results show that RepMD achieves the highest accuracy with 81.1% and has slight accuracy decreases when generalized to type-shifting and temporal-evolving memes. Human evaluation shows that RepMD can improve the efficiency of human discovery on harmful memes, with 15$\sim$30 seconds per meme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of left atrial wall and endocardium from LGE MRI is essential for quantifying atrial fibrosis, but accurate machine learning models are challenging due to limited data availability and anatomical complexity.

Method: Developed a pipeline to synthesize 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, SPADE-LDM). Synthetic images were evaluated for realism and impact on downstream LA segmentation with 3D U-Net.

Result: SPADE-LDM generated the most realistic images (FID: 4.063), outperforming Pix2Pix GAN (FID: 40.821) and SPADE-GAN (FID: 7.652). Augmentation with synthetic images improved LA cavity segmentation Dice score from 0.908 to 0.936 (statistically significant, p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Label-conditioned 3D synthesis can enhance segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures by augmenting scarce training data, with SPADE-LDM showing superior performance for generating realistic LGE MRI images.

Abstract: Segmentation of the left atrial (LA) wall and endocardium from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is essential for quantifying atrial fibrosis in patients with atrial fibrillation. The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures.

TL;DR: MiLDEAgent is a reasoning-based framework for multi-layer document editing that combines RL-trained multimodal reasoning with targeted image editing, significantly outperforming existing approaches on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world design documents (posters, etc.) are multi-layered with decoration, text, and images, but existing approaches overlook multi-layer editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation without proper layer-aware reasoning.

Method: MiLDEAgent combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. They also introduce MiLDEBench (20K+ design documents with editing instructions) and MiLDEEval (4-dimensional evaluation protocol).

Result: Experiments on 16 models show existing approaches fail: open-source models can't complete tasks, closed-source models violate formats. MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, outperforming all open-source baselines and matching closed-source models.

Conclusion: MiLDEAgent establishes the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing, addressing the gap in layer-aware reasoning for real-world design document editing from natural language instructions.

Abstract: Real-world design documents (e.g., posters) are inherently multi-layered, combining decoration, text, and images. Editing them from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained, layer-aware reasoning to identify relevant layers and coordinate modifications. Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-enabled human-centric cyber-physical systems (like medical monitoring and autonomous vehicles) can encounter uncertain operational conditions due to human-system interactions, potentially violating safety/security requirements.

Method: 1) Discuss operational deviations leading to unknown conditions, 2) Create framework to evaluate safety/security strategies for AI-enabled human-centric CPS, 3) Demonstrate with personalized image-based technique for detecting non-announcement of meals in closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics.

Result: The paper presents a framework for strategy evaluation and demonstrates a novel image-based technique for meal detection in diabetes management as a practical example.

Conclusion: A systematic approach is needed to ensure safety/security of AI-enabled human-centric CPS when they encounter uncertain operational conditions, with the proposed framework and case study providing practical solutions.

Abstract: In recent years, Human-centric cyber-physical systems have increasingly involved artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor-collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, as well as autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate according to the protocols and guidelines for regular system operations. However, in many scenarios, such as closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoring systems for stroke diagnosis. The operations of such AI-enabled human-centric applications can expose them to cases for which their operational mode may be uncertain, for instance, resulting from the interactions with a human with the system. Such cases, in which the system is in uncertain conditions, can violate the system's safety and security requirements. 
  This paper will discuss operational deviations that can lead these systems to operate in unknown conditions. We will then create a framework to evaluate different strategies for ensuring the safety and security of AI-enabled human-centric cyber-physical systems in operation deployment. Then, as an example, we show a personalized image-based novel technique for detecting the non-announcement of meals in closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with small, complexly shaped organs in head and neck segmentation. Hybrid architectures often just concatenate features without exploiting each component's unique strengths, leading to functional overlap and limited accuracy.

Method: Proposes HUR-MACL: 1) Adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using CNN, 2) Uses Vision Mamba and Deformable CNN jointly for these regions, 3) Introduces heterogeneous feature distillation loss to promote collaborative learning between architectures in high uncertainty regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on two public datasets and one private dataset for multi-organ segmentation in head and neck.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning approach effectively addresses limitations of existing hybrid models and significantly improves segmentation accuracy for challenging small organs.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs at risk in the head and neck is essential for radiation therapy, yet deep learning models often fail on small, complexly shaped organs. While hybrid architectures that combine different models show promise, they typically just concatenate features without exploiting the unique strengths of each component. This results in functional overlap and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck. This model adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using a convolutional neural network, and for these regions, Vision Mamba as well as Deformable CNN are utilized to jointly improve their segmentation accuracy. Additionally, a heterogeneous feature distillation loss was proposed to promote collaborative learning between the two architectures in high uncertainty regions to further enhance performance. Our method achieves SOTA results on two public datasets and one private dataset.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometric modeling is effective for text-to-image alignment assessment, addressing limitations of Euclidean methods by better capturing semantic structure and providing adaptive capabilities for different samples.

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-image generation technology, accurately assessing the alignment between generated images and text prompts has become a critical challenge. Existing methods rely on Euclidean space metrics, neglecting the structured nature of semantic alignment, while lacking adaptive capabilities for different samples. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, an adaptive text-to-image alignment assessment framework based on hyperbolic entailment geometry. First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score. HyperAlign achieves highly competitive performance on both single database evaluation and cross-database generalization tasks, fully validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometric modeling for image-text alignment assessment.

Benefits scale with question complexity.

Conclusion: The synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration enables efficient, high-performance agricultural disease diagnosis with strong generalization, demonstrating that smaller models can outperform larger ones through specialized reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: Agricultural disease diagnosis challenges VLMs, as conventional fine-tuning requires extensive labels, lacks interpretability, and generalizes poorly. While reasoning improves model robustness, existing methods rely on costly expert annotations and rarely address the open-ended, diverse nature of agricultural queries. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Agri-R1}, a reasoning-enhanced large model for agriculture. Our framework automates high-quality reasoning data generation via vision-language synthesis and LLM-based filtering, using only 19\% of available samples. Training employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel proposed reward function that integrates domain-specific lexicons and fuzzy matching to assess both correctness and linguistic flexibility in open-ended responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, our resulting 3B-parameter model achieves performance competitive with 7B- to 13B-parameter baselines, showing a +23.2\% relative gain in disease recognition accuracy, +33.3\% in agricultural knowledge QA, and a +26.10-point improvement in cross-domain generalization over standard fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration underpins these gains, with benefits scaling as question complexity increases.

Conclusion: DB-MSMUNet demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability for real-world pancreatic CT segmentation tasks, showing superior performance across multiple datasets through its innovative architecture combining global context modeling, local adaptation, and boundary refinement.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the pancreas and its lesions in CT scans is crucial for the precise diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, it remains a highly challenging task due to several factors such as low tissue contrast with surrounding organs, blurry anatomical boundaries, irregular organ shapes, and the small size of lesions. To tackle these issues, we propose DB-MSMUNet (Dual-Branch Multi-scale Mamba UNet), a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed specifically for robust pancreatic segmentation. The encoder is constructed using a Multi-scale Mamba Module (MSMM), which combines deformable convolutions and multi-scale state space modeling to enhance both global context modeling and local deformation adaptation. The network employs a dual-decoder design: the edge decoder introduces an Edge Enhancement Path (EEP) to explicitly capture boundary cues and refine fuzzy contours, while the area decoder incorporates a Multi-layer Decoder (MLD) to preserve fine-grained details and accurately reconstruct small lesions by leveraging multi-scale deep semantic features. Furthermore, Auxiliary Deep Supervision (ADS) heads are added at multiple scales to both decoders, providing more accurate gradient feedback and further enhancing the discriminative capability of multi-scale features. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets: the NIH Pancreas dataset, the MSD dataset, and a clinical pancreatic tumor dataset provided by collaborating hospitals. DB-MSMUNet achieves Dice Similarity Coefficients of 89.47%, 87.59%, and 89.02%, respectively, outperforming most existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, edge preservation, and robustness across different datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method for real-world pancreatic CT segmentation tasks.

### [27] [HATIR: Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent Infrared Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04682)
*Yang Zou,Xingyue Zhu,Kaiqi Han,Jun Ma,Xingyuan Li,Zhiying Jiang,Jinyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HATIR is a diffusion-based method for infrared video super-resolution that jointly addresses atmospheric turbulence and low-resolution degradation using heat-aware deformation priors and turbulence-aware flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared videos suffer from severe atmospheric turbulence and compression degradation, but existing VSR methods either ignore the modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Cascading turbulence mitigation with VSR leads to error propagation due to decoupled degradation modeling.

Method: HATIR uses heat-aware diffusion that injects deformation priors into diffusion sampling to jointly model turbulence degradation and detail loss. It features: 1) Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator leveraging thermal consistency for turbulence-aware flow, and 2) Turbulence-Aware Decoder with turbulence gating and structure-aware attention to suppress unstable cues and enhance edge recovery.

Result: The authors built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR with 640 diverse scenes from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024×768). This enables future research and demonstrates HATIR's effectiveness in jointly addressing turbulence and super-resolution.

Conclusion: HATIR provides an integrated solution for turbulent infrared video super-resolution by jointly modeling turbulence and resolution degradation through heat-aware diffusion, with the new FLIR-IVSR dataset advancing infrared VSR research.

Abstract: Infrared video has been of great interest in visual tasks under challenging environments, but often suffers from severe atmospheric turbulence and compression degradation. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR. Project page: https://github.com/JZ0606/HATIR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency trading requires timely integration of heterogeneous web information and market signals, but existing systems struggle with noisy multi-source evidence and rapid price shocks at sub-second timescales.

Method: Proposes WebCryptoAgent with modality-specific agents for different information sources, consolidates outputs into unified evidence documents, and uses decoupled control architecture separating strategic hourly reasoning from real-time second-level risk models.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world cryptocurrency markets show improved trading stability, reduced spurious activity, and enhanced tail-risk handling compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: WebCryptoAgent effectively addresses challenges in cryptocurrency trading by combining structured multi-source evidence synthesis with decoupled real-time risk control for better performance and robustness.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading increasingly depends on timely integration of heterogeneous web information and market microstructure signals to support short-horizon decision making under extreme volatility. However, existing trading systems struggle to jointly reason over noisy multi-source web evidence while maintaining robustness to rapid price shocks at sub-second timescales. The first challenge lies in synthesizing unstructured web content, social sentiment, and structured OHLCV signals into coherent and interpretable trading decisions without amplifying spurious correlations, while the second challenge concerns risk control, as slow deliberative reasoning pipelines are ill-suited for handling abrupt market shocks that require immediate defensive responses. To address these challenges, we propose WebCryptoAgent, an agentic trading framework that decomposes web-informed decision making into modality-specific agents and consolidates their outputs into a unified evidence document for confidence-calibrated reasoning. We further introduce a decoupled control architecture that separates strategic hourly reasoning from a real-time second-level risk model, enabling fast shock detection and protective intervention independent of the trading loop. Extensive experiments on real-world cryptocurrency markets demonstrate that WebCryptoAgent improves trading stability, reduces spurious activity, and enhances tail-risk handling compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: Forge-and-Quench is a unified framework that enhances image generation by leveraging multimodal understanding models to improve fidelity and detail richness through bridge features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While integrating image generation and understanding is important, how understanding can effectively assist generation (particularly for improving fidelity and detail richness) has not been fully explored. Previous works focused on reasoning abilities and world knowledge, but not on enhancing visual quality.

Method: Proposes Forge-and-Quench framework: 1) MLLM reasons over conversational context to produce enhanced text instruction, 2) Bridge Adapter maps this to virtual visual representation (Bridge Feature), 3) This feature is injected into T2I backbone as visual guidance alongside enhanced text instruction, replacing original input.

Result: Framework shows exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant training overhead savings. Experiments show significant improvements in image fidelity and detail across multiple models while maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Conclusion: Forge-and-Quench successfully demonstrates how understanding models can enhance image generation quality through bridge features, offering a practical framework that preserves MLLM capabilities while improving T2I performance with minimal training overhead.

Abstract: Integrating image generation and understanding into a single framework has become a pivotal goal in the multimodal domain. However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC) has escalated the threat of deepfakes, from facial manipulations to the synthesis of entire photorealistic human bodies. However, existing detection methods remain fragmented, specializing either in facial-region forgeries or full-body synthetic images, and consequently fail to generalize across the full spectrum of human image manipulations.

Result: Achieves strong open-vocabulary 3DGS understanding while completing semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, which is two times faster than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProFuse provides an efficient, context-aware framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding that enhances consistency and cohesion with minimal overhead, requiring no additional optimization beyond standard reconstruction while retaining geometric refinement.

Abstract: We present ProFuse, an efficient context-aware framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The pipeline enhances cross-view consistency and intra-mask cohesion within a direct registration setup, adding minimal overhead and requiring no render-supervised fine-tuning. Instead of relying on a pretrained 3DGS scene, we introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views. With associations established in advance, semantic fusion requires no additional optimization beyond standard reconstruction, and the model retains geometric refinement without densification. ProFuse achieves strong open-vocabulary 3DGS understanding while completing semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, which is two times faster than SOTA.

Motivation: Existing monocular shape-from-polarization methods suffer from azimuth angle ambiguity, an inherent limitation of polarization analysis that severely compromises reconstruction accuracy and stability.

Method: Proposes SMSfP framework with: 1) Polarization-aided adaptive region growing (PARG) segmentation to decompose global convexity into locally convex regions, suppressing azimuth ambiguities; 2) Multi-scale fusion convexity prior (MFCP) constraint to ensure local surface consistency and enhance fine detail recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show significant improvements in disambiguation accuracy and geometric fidelity compared to existing physics-based monocular SfP techniques.

Conclusion: The segmentation-driven approach effectively addresses azimuth ambiguity in monocular shape-from-polarization, providing more accurate and stable 3D reconstruction through local convex region decomposition and multi-scale consistency constraints.

Abstract: Monocular shape-from-polarization (SfP) leverages the intrinsic relationship between light polarization properties and surface geometry to recover surface normals from single-view polarized images, providing a compact and robust approach for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Despite its potential, existing monocular SfP methods suffer from azimuth angle ambiguity, an inherent limitation of polarization analysis, that severely compromises reconstruction accuracy and stability. This paper introduces a novel segmentation-driven monocular SfP (SMSfP) framework that reformulates global shape recovery into a set of local reconstructions over adaptively segmented convex sub-regions. Specifically, a polarization-aided adaptive region growing (PARG) segmentation strategy is proposed to decompose the global convexity assumption into locally convex regions, effectively suppressing azimuth ambiguities and preserving surface continuity. Furthermore, a multi-scale fusion convexity prior (MFCP) constraint is developed to ensure local surface consistency and enhance the recovery of fine textural and structural details. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed approach, showing significant improvements in disambiguation accuracy and geometric fidelity compared with existing physics-based monocular SfP techniques.

Result: Outperforms previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% on MIG-Bench and 9.7% on MC-Bench for multi-image grounding, achieves 9.1% improvement over base model on ODINW for single-image grounding, while retaining strong multi-image understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: GeM-VG demonstrates superior generalized grounding capabilities across diverse multi-image tasks through unified modeling and effective training strategy, advancing the field of multimodal visual grounding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in single-image grounding and general multi-image understanding. Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed counterfactual generation framework and MixDPO approach effectively mitigate action and temporal hallucinations in VLMs by addressing over-reliance on language priors through synthetic visual hard negatives.

Abstract: Video-language models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal understanding but remain prone to hallucinations, especially when reasoning about actions and temporal order. Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks.

### [38] [Defocus Aberration Theory Confirms Gaussian Model in Most Imaging Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04779)
*Akbar Saadat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper validates that Gaussian model is accurate for defocus operators in most imaging devices, with less than 1% error, enabling reliable depth estimation from defocus blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation from 2D images remains a fundamental challenge in 3D recovery. While defocus provides valuable depth information, accurately estimating depth is difficult due to the ill-posed nature of distinguishing desired defocus blur from inherent image blur. The Gaussian model offers mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency for real-time applications, but its applicability needs validation for practical imaging devices.

Method: The paper introduces specific settings for conventional imaging devices to ensure defocus operators adhere to the Gaussian model. Analysis begins with geometric optics framework and uses defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to evaluate the accuracy of fitting actual defocus models to Gaussian approximations. The study examines typical focused depths between 1-100 meters with maximum depth variation of 10% at focused depth.

Result: Results confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices. The findings demonstrate maximum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1%, validating the model's accuracy and reliability for practical depth estimation applications.

Conclusion: The Gaussian model is both theoretically sound and practically applicable for defocus-based depth estimation, providing a computationally efficient solution for real-time applications while maintaining high accuracy (less than 1% error) across typical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Over the past three decades, defocus has consistently provided groundbreaking depth information in scene images. However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices. The findings demonstrate a maximum Mean Absolute Error $(\!M\!A\!E)$ of less than $1\%$, underscoring the model's accuracy and reliability.

Motivation: MRI has limitations in acquisition time, cost, and resolution. While Pix2Pix has been used for medical image translation, its potential hasn't been fully explored, especially for improving image generation quality and structural fidelity.

Method: Proposed enhanced Pix2Pix framework integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) for channel attention and U-Net++ for multi-scale feature fusion, with a simplified PatchGAN discriminator for training stability and local anatomical realism.

Result: Under few-shot conditions (<500 images), the method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively extends Pix2Pix for medical image translation, addressing MRI limitations while maintaining high quality and structural accuracy even with limited training data.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed tissue information, but its clinical application is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and restricted resolution. Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.

TL;DR: MCLC is a plug-and-play correction module that stabilizes latent diffusion inverse solvers by reducing the gap between solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics through measurement-consistent Langevin updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from instability, undesirable artifacts, and degraded quality due to discrepancy between solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics. Prior approaches rely on linear manifold assumptions that often don't hold in latent space.

Method: Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC) - a theoretically grounded plug-and-play module that remedies LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates without relying on linear manifold assumptions.

Result: MCLC demonstrates effectiveness and compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks, provides more stable and reliable behavior, and offers insights into blob artifacts and their underlying causes.

Conclusion: MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers by stabilizing latent diffusion models through theoretically grounded correction of reverse diffusion dynamics.

Abstract: With recent advances in generative models, diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems in each domain. Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pyramidal diffusion models reduce computational cost by processing different noise levels at varying resolutions, but existing open-source versions underperform. This work converts pretrained diffusion models into pyramidal ones via low-cost finetuning without quality degradation, and explores step distillation for further efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source pyramidal video diffusion models are trained from scratch and underperform compared to state-of-the-art systems in visual quality. There's a need to leverage pretrained diffusion models more effectively while maintaining the computational efficiency benefits of pyramidal architectures.

Method: Develops a pipeline to convert pretrained diffusion models into pyramidal ones through low-cost finetuning. Also investigates and compares various strategies for step distillation within pyramidal models to enhance inference efficiency.

Result: Successfully transforms pretrained diffusion models into pyramidal versions without degradation in output video quality. The conversion pipeline enables computational efficiency gains while maintaining visual plausibility comparable to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that pretrained diffusion models can be efficiently converted into pyramidal architectures through targeted finetuning, achieving computational benefits without sacrificing quality. Step distillation strategies further enhance inference efficiency in pyramidal models.

Abstract: Recently proposed pyramidal models decompose the conventional forward and backward diffusion processes into multiple stages operating at varying resolutions. These models handle inputs with higher noise levels at lower resolutions, while less noisy inputs are processed at higher resolutions. This hierarchical approach significantly reduces the computational cost of inference in multi-step denoising models. However, existing open-source pyramidal video models have been trained from scratch and tend to underperform compared to state-of-the-art systems in terms of visual plausibility. In this work, we present a pipeline that converts a pretrained diffusion model into a pyramidal one through low-cost finetuning, achieving this transformation without degradation in quality of output videos. Furthermore, we investigate and compare various strategies for step distillation within pyramidal models, aiming to further enhance the inference efficiency.

*Tamara R. Lenhard,Andreas Weinmann,Hichem Snoussi,Tobias Koch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMURAI foundation model shows strong potential for drone tracking, and a detector-augmented extension significantly improves robustness in urban surveillance scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone tracking is critical for surveillance but current RGB-based methods are limited and rely on conventional motion models. Foundation models like SAMURAI show strong tracking performance in other domains but haven't been evaluated for drone-specific scenarios.

Method: Systematic evaluation of SAMURAI for drone tracking, plus a detector-augmented extension to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length.

Result: The detector-augmented extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, especially for long-duration sequences and drone exit-re-entry events. Success rate improvements up to +0.393 and FNR reductions up to -0.475 over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: SAMURAI shows promising potential for drone tracking, and detector augmentation enhances its robustness, making it suitable for practical urban surveillance applications.

Abstract: Robust long-term tracking of drone is a critical requirement for modern surveillance systems, given their increasing threat potential. While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts. Despite its practical relevance, research on RGB-based drone tracking is still limited and largely reliant on conventional motion models. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance. However, their applicability in drone-specific scenarios has not been investigated yet. Motivated by this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI's potential for robust drone tracking in urban surveillance settings. Furthermore, we introduce a detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events. The incorporation of detector cues yields consistent gains over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance across datasets and metrics, with success rate improvements of up to +0.393 and FNR reductions of up to -0.475.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancement method effectively improves the readability of ancient Marathi inscription images, with preprocessing techniques successfully addressing degradation challenges in historical documents.

Abstract: Ancient script images often suffer from severe background noise, low contrast, and degradation caused by aging and environmental effects. In many cases, the foreground text and background exhibit similar visual characteristics, making the inscriptions difficult to read. The primary objective of image enhancement is to improve the readability of such degraded ancient images. This paper presents an image enhancement approach based on binarization and complementary preprocessing techniques for removing stains and enhancing unclear ancient text. The proposed methods are evaluated on different types of ancient scripts, including inscriptions on stone, metal plates, and historical documents. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves classification accuracies of 55.7%, 62%, and 65.6% for stone, metal plate, and document scripts, respectively, using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, accuracies of 53.2%, 59.5%, and 67.8% are obtained. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement method in improving the readability of ancient Marathi inscription images.

*Oriol Rabasseda,Zenjie Li,Kamal Nasrollahi,Sergio Escalera*

TL;DR: SOVABench is a new surveillance video retrieval benchmark focusing on vehicle action discrimination, with a training-free MLLM framework for interpretable embeddings that outperforms existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity but lack evaluation of action discrimination needed for surveillance applications, creating a gap for vehicle-related action analysis.

Method: Introduces SOVABench benchmark with two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair), and a training-free framework using MLLMs to generate interpretable embeddings from descriptions for images/videos.

Result: The MLLM-based framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench and other spatial/counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail, showing action discrimination remains challenging for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SOVABench addresses surveillance action discrimination gap, and the MLLM framework provides effective interpretable embeddings, with code and benchmark resources publicly available.

Abstract: Automatic identification of events and recurrent behavior analysis are critical for video surveillance. However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models.
  Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail. The code, annotations, and instructions to construct the benchmark are publicly available.

### [45] [Character Detection using YOLO for Writer Identification in multiple Medieval books](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04834)
*Alessandra Scotto di Freca,Tiziana D Alessandro,Francesco Fontanella,Filippo Sarria,Claudio De Stefano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using YOLO object detection instead of template matching to identify scribes in medieval manuscripts by detecting the letter "a", achieving better accuracy and enabling reliable writer identification in unseen manuscripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paleography faces challenges in dating manuscripts and understanding writing evolution through scribe identification. While digital technologies have advanced, the general problem remains unsolved. Previous template matching approaches had limitations requiring appropriate thresholds, prompting exploration of more robust methods.

Method: The authors replaced their previous template matching and CNN approach with YOLO v5 object detection model to identify scribes. They focus on detecting the letter "a" as a distinctive feature across manuscript pages, using YOLO to extract letter instances followed by classification to attribute each instance to the correct scribe.

Result: YOLO effectively extracts more letters than template matching, leading to more accurate second-stage classification. The YOLO confidence score enables development of a rejection threshold system, allowing reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts.

Conclusion: YOLO object detection outperforms template matching for scribe identification in medieval manuscripts, providing a more robust foundation for paleographic analysis with potential for application to unseen documents.

Abstract: Paleography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, its key objectives include the dating of manuscripts and understanding the evolution of writing. Estimating when a document was written and tracing the development of scripts and writing styles can be aided by identifying the individual scribes who contributed to a medieval manuscript. Although digital technologies have made significant progress in this field, the general problem remains unsolved and continues to pose open challenges. ... We previously proposed an approach focused on identifying specific letters or abbreviations that characterize each writer. In that study, we considered the letter "a", as it was widely present on all pages of text and highly distinctive, according to the suggestions of expert paleographers. We used template matching techniques to detect the occurrences of the character "a" on each page and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to attribute each instance to the correct scribe. Moving from the interesting results achieved from this previous system and being aware of the limitations of the template matching technique, which requires an appropriate threshold to work, we decided to experiment in the same framework with the use of the YOLO object detection model to identify the scribe who contributed to the writing of different medieval books. We considered the fifth version of YOLO to implement the YOLO object detection model, which completely substituted the template matching and CNN used in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLO effectively extracts a greater number of letters considered, leading to a more accurate second-stage classification. Furthermore, the YOLO confidence score provides a foundation for developing a system that applies a rejection threshold, enabling reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts.

*Ayush Pande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivAS is an optimization-free, interactive framework for segmenting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) that uses 2D SAM masks refined with NeRF depth priors and aggregates them into 3D voxels in real-time without per-scene training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF segmentation methods are optimization-based, requiring slow per-scene training and sacrificing the zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models. There's a need for faster, interactive approaches that leverage 2D models while maintaining 3D geometric accuracy.

Method: DivAS uses a GUI workflow where users provide point prompts to generate 2D SAM masks, which are then refined using NeRF-derived depth priors for better geometric accuracy. A custom CUDA kernel aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time feedback without optimization.

Result: Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360° and LLFF datasets show DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time.

Conclusion: DivAS provides an optimization-free, fully interactive framework for NeRF segmentation that combines the strengths of 2D foundation models with 3D geometric priors, enabling real-time segmentation without per-scene training while maintaining quality comparable to slower optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: Existing methods for segmenting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are often optimization-based, requiring slow per-scene training that sacrifices the zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models. We introduce DivAS (Depth-interactive Voxel Aggregation Segmentation), an optimization-free, fully interactive framework that addresses these limitations. Our method operates via a fast GUI-based workflow where 2D SAM masks, generated from user point prompts, are refined using NeRF-derived depth priors to improve geometric accuracy and foreground-background separation. The core of our contribution is a custom CUDA kernel that aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time visual feedback. This optimization-free design eliminates the need for per-scene training. Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360° and LLFF show that DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time.

*Suyash Mishra,Qiang Li,Srikanth Patil,Satyanarayan Pati,Baddu Narendra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Industrial framework for processing 200K+ PDFs, 25K+ videos, and multilingual audio in pharmaceutical domains, with analysis of 40+ VLMs showing 3-8x efficiency gains and multimodality benefits for long-form video understanding under GPU constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VLM evaluations focus on short videos with unconstrained resources, but industrial settings like pharmaceutical content understanding require processing long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints where existing approaches fail to scale.

Method: Developed industrial GenAI framework processing large-scale multimodal data (PDFs, videos, audio), empirically analyzed over 40 VLMs on benchmarks (Video-MME, MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas.

Result: Achieved 3-8x efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improved up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), identified bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across VLMs.

Conclusion: Rather than proposing new models, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, providing actionable guidance for designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, yet most evaluations focus on short videos and assume unconstrained computational resources. In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new "A+B" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study of rotation-robust learning using Convolutional Model Trees with geometry-aware inductive biases and deployment-time orientation search for improved robustness under image rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop rotation-robust learning methods for image inputs that can handle geometric transformations at deployment time, particularly in-plane rotations, using structured model trees.

Method: Use Convolutional Model Trees (CMTs) with three geometry-aware inductive biases: convolutional smoothing, tilt dominance constraint, and importance-based pruning. Also implement deployment-time orientation search that selects discrete rotations maximizing forest-level confidence without updating model parameters.

Result: Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness. Consistent trends observed on MNIST digit recognition implemented as one-vs-rest regression.

Conclusion: The paper highlights both promise and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection for model-tree ensembles, showing that while orientation search enhances robustness to severe rotations, confidence misalignment near canonical orientations can degrade performance.

Abstract: We study rotation-robust learning for image inputs using Convolutional Model Trees (CMTs) [1], whose split and leaf coefficients can be structured on the image grid and transformed geometrically at deployment time. In a controlled MNIST setting with a rotation-invariant regression target, we introduce three geometry-aware inductive biases for split directions -- convolutional smoothing, a tilt dominance constraint, and importance-based pruning -- and quantify their impact on robustness under in-plane rotations. We further evaluate a deployment-time orientation search that selects a discrete rotation maximizing a forest-level confidence proxy without updating model parameters. Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near the canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness. Finally, we observe consistent trends on MNIST digit recognition implemented as one-vs-rest regression, highlighting both the promise and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection for model-tree ensembles.

### [49] [Prototypicality Bias Reveals Blindspots in Multimodal Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04946)
*Subhadeep Roy,Gagan Bhatia,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies prototypicality bias in multimodal evaluation metrics, creates a benchmark to test this bias, finds current metrics fail to prioritize semantic correctness over visual prototypes, and proposes a new metric that reduces these failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic metrics for text-to-image evaluation may not truly assess semantic correctness but instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. There's a need to understand whether these metrics prioritize textual semantics or default to prototypes.

Method: The authors introduce ProtoBias, a controlled contrastive benchmark spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images. It pairs semantically correct but non-prototypical images with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. They evaluate widely used metrics (CLIPScore, PickScore, VQA-based scores) and LLM-as-Judge systems on this benchmark, and propose ProtoScore, a robust 7B-parameter metric designed to reduce prototypicality bias.

Result: Current metrics frequently misrank pairs in the ProtoBias benchmark, favoring prototypical but incorrect images over semantically correct but non-prototypical ones. LLM-as-Judge systems show uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favor semantic correctness with larger margins. ProtoScore substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Automatic multimodal evaluation metrics suffer from prototypicality bias, prioritizing visual and social prototypes over semantic correctness. The proposed ProtoScore metric offers a more robust alternative that better aligns with human judgment while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \textsc{\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\textit{\textbf{Proto}typical \textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.

TL;DR: TEA: A temporal adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method that enhances model resilience under varying sequence lengths through teacher-student knowledge transfer and full-sequence reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SITS segmentation approaches overlook generalization across scenarios with varying temporal lengths, leading to poor segmentation results when sequence lengths differ from training data.

Method: Proposes TEA with a teacher model containing global sequence knowledge that guides a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Uses intermediate embedding, prototypes, and soft labels for knowledge transfer, dynamic aggregation to mitigate forgetting, and full-sequence reconstruction as auxiliary task.

Result: Demonstrates remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: TEA effectively addresses the temporal length generalization problem in SITS segmentation, providing a robust solution for agricultural crop mapping applications with varying temporal data availability.

Abstract: Crop mapping based on satellite images time-series (SITS) holds substantial economic value in agricultural production settings, in which parcel segmentation is an essential step. Existing approaches have achieved notable advancements in SITS segmentation with predetermined sequence lengths. However, we found that these approaches overlooked the generalization capability of models across scenarios with varying temporal length, leading to markedly poor segmentation results in such cases. To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method brings remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseLaneSTP: A sparse lane transformer that integrates lane geometric priors and temporal information for improved 3D lane detection, with a new auto-labeled dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D lane detection methods have limitations: dense BEV approaches suffer from poor feature representation due to erroneous transformations, sparse detectors ignore valuable lane-specific priors, and no methods utilize historical lane observations to resolve visibility ambiguities.

Method: SparseLaneSTP integrates geometric properties of lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces: 1) lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, 2) continuous lane representation for sparse architectures, and 3) temporal regularization. Also creates a new precise 3D lane dataset using auto-labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks and on their novel dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating lane geometric priors and temporal information into sparse architectures significantly improves 3D lane detection, and the new auto-labeled dataset addresses weaknesses in existing datasets.

Abstract: 3D lane detection has emerged as a critical challenge in autonomous driving, encompassing identification and localization of lane markings and the 3D road surface. Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.

*Minseong Kweon,Jinsun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OceanSplat: 3D Gaussian Splatting for underwater scenes using trinocular view consistency and synthetic epipolar depth prior to overcome optical degradation and reduce floating artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater scenes suffer from optical degradation (scattering, absorption) causing multi-view inconsistencies in 3D reconstruction. Existing methods struggle with floating artifacts and medium-induced primitives that obscure true object geometry.

Method: 1) Trinocular view consistency: render horizontally/vertically translated camera views and align via inverse warping; 2) Synthetic epipolar depth prior: triangulation from translated views for self-supervised depth regularization; 3) Depth-aware alpha adjustment: modulate Gaussian opacity based on z-component and viewing direction during early training.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing methods on real-world underwater and simulated scenes for both scene reconstruction and restoration. Effectively disentangles 3D Gaussians from scattering medium, reduces floating artifacts, and preserves object geometry.

Conclusion: OceanSplat enables robust 3D Gaussian representation in underwater environments by enforcing geometric constraints and depth regularization, overcoming optical degradation challenges and improving reconstruction quality in scattering media.

Abstract: We introduce OceanSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting-based approach for accurately representing 3D geometry in underwater scenes. To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by underwater optical degradation, our method enforces trinocular view consistency by rendering horizontally and vertically translated camera views relative to each input view and aligning them via inverse warping. Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes. Experiments on real-world underwater and simulated scenes demonstrate that OceanSplat substantially outperforms existing methods for both scene reconstruction and restoration in scattering media.

*Jens Bayer,Stefan Becker,David Münch,Michael Arens,Jürgen Beyerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Higher-order adversarial attacks show stronger generalization than lower-order attacks, and adversarial training alone is insufficient to defend object detectors against them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the cat-and-mouse game between adversarial attacks and defenses, specifically examining how higher-order adversarial attacks impact object detectors and whether adversarial training provides sufficient protection.

Method: The researchers use YOLOv10 as a representative object detector and apply adversarial patches in evasion attacks. They successively train attack patterns and harden detectors with adversarial training, creating higher-order adversarial attacks through iterative cycles of attack generation and defense training.

Result: Higher-order adversarial patches demonstrate stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order patches, affecting not just the directly trained detector but showing broader effectiveness. Adversarial training alone proves insufficient to efficiently harden object detectors against these attacks.

Conclusion: The cat-and-mouse game between adversarial attacks and defenses continues, with higher-order attacks posing significant threats to object detectors. Current adversarial training methods are inadequate against these sophisticated attacks, highlighting the need for more robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Higher-order adversarial attacks can directly be considered the result of a cat-and-mouse game -- an elaborate action involving constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes. This idiom describes the enduring circular training of adversarial attack patterns and adversarial training the best. The following work investigates the impact of higher-order adversarial attacks on object detectors by successively training attack patterns and hardening object detectors with adversarial training. The YOLOv10 object detector is chosen as a representative, and adversarial patches are used in an evasion attack manner. Our results indicate that higher-order adversarial patches are not only affecting the object detector directly trained on but rather provide a stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order adversarial patches. Moreover, the results highlight that solely adversarial training is not sufficient to harden an object detector efficiently against this kind of adversarial attack.

*Ruochen Chen,Thuy Tran,Shaifali Parashar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolyFit: A patch-based surface representation using local jet functions that enables efficient surface deformation by updating compact jet coefficients instead of per-vertex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surface deformation methods often require expensive per-vertex optimization for downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. There's a need for more efficient representations that can generalize across different surface types while maintaining accuracy.

Method: PolyFit learns a patch-based surface representation by fitting jet functions locally on surface patches. This supervised learning approach works with both analytic functions and real data. The representation allows surface deformation through updating compact jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive performance in two applications: 1) Shape-from-template: achieves competitive accuracy with test-time optimization that's faster than offline physics-based solvers and more accurate than physics-guided neural simulators; 2) Garment draping: trains a self-supervised, mesh- and garment-agnostic model that generalizes across resolutions and garment types, delivering up to 10x faster inference than baselines.

Conclusion: PolyFit provides an efficient, generalizable patch-based surface representation that enables fast and accurate surface deformation for various computer vision and graphics applications, offering significant speed advantages over existing methods while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a patch-based representation of surfaces, PolyFit, which is obtained by fitting jet functions locally on surface patches. Such a representation can be learned efficiently in a supervised fashion from both analytic functions and real data. Once learned, it can be generalized to various types of surfaces. Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video. Using PolyFit, we adopt test-time optimization that delivers competitive accuracy while being markedly faster than offline physics-based solvers, and outperforms recent physics-guided neural simulators in accuracy at modest additional runtime. 2) Garment draping. We train a self-supervised, mesh- and garment-agnostic model that generalizes across resolutions and garment types, delivering up to an order-of-magnitude faster inference than strong baselines.

*Suyash Mishra,Qiang Li,Srikanth Patil,Anubhav Girdhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework using ALMs and VLMs for pharmaceutical content processing, achieving 3-4x speedup and 4x cost reduction with improved clip quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of heterogeneous pharmaceutical data (text, images, video, audio, web links) is inconsistent, inefficient, and struggles with long content like clinical trial interviews and educational seminars, hindering digital transformation.

Method: A domain-adapted framework integrating Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with: (1) Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, (2) personalization via role definition and prompt injection, (3) cost-efficient end-to-end pipeline balancing ALM/VLM processing.

Result: 3-4x speedup, 4x cost reduction, competitive clip quality on Video MME benchmark (900 videos) and proprietary dataset (16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas). Improved clip coherence (0.348) and informativeness (0.721) scores over SOTA VLM baselines like Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: The framework enables transparent, custom extractive, and compliance-supporting video summarization for life sciences, demonstrating the potential of VLMs for intelligent, scalable pharmaceutical content processing.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are poised to revolutionize the digital transformation of pharmacyceutical industry by enabling intelligent, scalable, and automated multi-modality content processing. Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).
  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.

Motivation: The paper aims to develop a simple yet efficient end-to-end autonomous driving system that can handle multi-camera inputs while maintaining accuracy and enabling interpretable behavior-conditioned driving.

Method: Uses pretrained Vision Transformers with camera-aware register tokens to compress multi-camera features into compact scene representations.

Conclusion: A pure-transformer architecture with targeted token compression is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end autonomous driving, offering interpretable behavior-conditioned driving through learned sub-scores.

Abstract: We present DrivoR, a simple and efficient transformer-based architecture for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving.

TL;DR: Unsupervised 3D pseudo-labeling method that leverages temporal-geometric consistency in LiDAR data to generate semantic labels, bounding boxes, and dense scans without manual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlabeled LiDAR logs are abundant but useless without human labels, creating a major cost barrier for autonomous perception research. The paper aims to overcome this by using temporal-geometric consistency to automatically generate 3D labels.

Method: Uses temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift text and 2D vision foundation model cues into 3D. Features unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling with geometric priors from accumulated LiDAR maps, iterative update rules for joint geometric-semantic consistency, and moving object detection from inconsistencies.

Result: Method produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans with robust generalization across three datasets. Outperforms existing pseudo-labeling methods and improves depth prediction by 51.5% and 22.0% MAE in 80-150m and 150-250m ranges respectively.

Conclusion: The approach successfully tackles the labeling bottleneck in autonomous perception by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency to generate high-quality 3D pseudo-labels without manual supervision, demonstrating significant improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Unlabeled LiDAR logs, in autonomous driving applications, are inherently a gold mine of dense 3D geometry hiding in plain sight - yet they are almost useless without human labels, highlighting a dominant cost barrier for autonomous-perception research. In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies. Our method simultaneously produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans, demonstrating robust generalization across three datasets. We experimentally validate that our method compares favorably to existing semantic segmentation and object detection pseudo-labeling methods, which often require additional manual supervision. We confirm that even a small fraction of our geometrically consistent, densified LiDAR improves depth prediction by 51.5% and 22.0% MAE in the 80-150 and 150-250 meters range, respectively.

*Zirui Wu,Zeren Jiang,Martin R. Oswald,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes projective conditioning for view synthesis, replacing raw camera parameters with stable 2D projective cues to improve geometric consistency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward view synthesis models use Plücker ray maps that tie predictions to arbitrary world coordinates, making them sensitive to small camera transformations and undermining geometric consistency. The authors seek better conditioning inputs for robust and consistent view synthesis.

Method: Proposes projective conditioning which replaces raw camera parameters with target-view projective cues (stable 2D inputs), reframing the task from brittle geometric regression in ray space to well-conditioned image-to-image translation. Also introduces masked autoencoding pretraining tailored to these cues to leverage large-scale uncalibrated data.

Result: The method shows improved fidelity and stronger cross-view consistency compared to ray-conditioned baselines on their view-consistency benchmark, and achieves state-of-the-art quality on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Conclusion: Projective conditioning provides more stable and robust conditioning for view synthesis models, enabling better geometric consistency and performance by transforming the problem into a well-conditioned image-to-image translation task rather than brittle geometric regression.

Abstract: Feed-forward view synthesis models predict a novel view in a single pass with minimal 3D inductive bias. Existing works encode cameras as Plücker ray maps, which tie predictions to the arbitrary world coordinate gauge and make them sensitive to small camera transformations, thereby undermining geometric consistency. In this paper, we ask what inputs best condition a model for robust and consistent view synthesis. We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem. Additionally, we introduce a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy tailored to this cue, enabling the use of large-scale uncalibrated data for pretraining. Our method shows improved fidelity and stronger cross-view consistency compared to ray-conditioned baselines on our view-consistency benchmark. It also achieves state-of-the-art quality on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Re-Align is a unified framework that bridges understanding and generation in in-context image tasks through structured reasoning-guided alignment, using IC-CoT to decouple semantic guidance from reference association and RL training with surrogate rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models have strong understanding capabilities but fail to effectively transfer these strengths to image generation tasks, creating a gap between understanding and generation in in-context image generation and editing.

Method: 1) In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT) - structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association; 2) RL training scheme using surrogate rewards to measure alignment between structured reasoning text and generated images.

Result: Extensive experiments show Re-Align outperforms competitive methods of comparable model scale and resources on both in-context image generation and editing tasks.

Conclusion: Re-Align successfully bridges the understanding-generation gap through structured reasoning-guided alignment, providing a unified framework that improves performance on ICGE tasks by better executing user intent from interleaved image-text prompts.

Abstract: In-context image generation and editing (ICGE) enables users to specify visual concepts through interleaved image-text prompts, demanding precise understanding and faithful execution of user intent. Although recent unified multimodal models exhibit promising understanding capabilities, these strengths often fail to transfer effectively to image generation. We introduce Re-Align, a unified framework that bridges the gap between understanding and generation through structured reasoning-guided alignment. At its core lies the In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT), a structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association, providing clear textual target and mitigating confusion among reference images. Furthermore, Re-Align introduces an effective RL training scheme that leverages a surrogate reward to measure the alignment between structured reasoning text and the generated image, thereby improving the model's overall performance on ICGE tasks. Extensive experiments verify that Re-Align outperforms competitive methods of comparable model scale and resources on both in-context image generation and editing tasks.

Motivation: To develop a systematic approach for analyzing and improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) applied to Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) by exploring their visual embedding space to identify and address performance issues.

Method: VERSE enables visualization of latent representations to assess model feasibility, identifies problematic regions in the embedding space, and guides generation of synthetic data targeting those specific clusters for retraining.

Conclusion: VERSE provides an effective methodology for analyzing and improving VLMs for document understanding through visualization, targeted synthetic data generation, and optimization, enabling on-premise models to compete with or outperform commercial SaaS solutions.

Abstract: This work introduces VERSE, a methodology for analyzing and improving Vision-Language Models applied to Visually-rich Document Understanding by exploring their visual embedding space. VERSE enables the visualization of latent representations, supporting the assessment of model feasibility. It also facilitates the identification of problematic regions and guides the generation of synthetic data to enhance performance in those clusters. We validate the methodology by training on the synthetic MERIT Dataset and evaluating on its real-world counterpart, MERIT Secret. Results show that VERSE helps uncover the visual features associated with error-prone clusters, and that retraining with samples containing these features substantially boosts F1 performance without degrading generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on-premise models such as Donut and Idefics2, when optimized with VERSE, match or even surpass the performance of SaaS solutions like GPT-4 and Pixtral.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VerseCrafter is a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit control over camera and object dynamics using a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, trained on automatically extracted 4D annotations from in-the-wild videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle to provide unified and precise control over both camera and multi-object motion, as they operate in the 2D image plane rather than in a 4D geometric world state.

Method: Introduces a 4D Geometric Control representation encoding world state through static background point clouds and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This captures object paths and probabilistic 3D occupancy over time. The 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model. An automatic data engine extracts required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos to address data scarcity.

Result: Enables generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to specified camera and object dynamics, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models.

Conclusion: VerseCrafter bridges the gap between 2D video generation and 4D geometric control, providing a unified framework for precise manipulation of both camera and object motion in video world models.

Abstract: Video world models aim to simulate dynamic, real-world environments, yet existing methods struggle to provide unified and precise control over camera and multi-object motion, as videos inherently operate dynamics in the projected 2D image plane. To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset.

TL;DR: MuLo-SD accelerates autoregressive image generation using multi-resolution drafting with local rejection/resampling, achieving 1.7× speedup while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image synthesis suffer from latency due to sequential nature. Existing speculative decoding approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack spatial awareness.

Method: Multi-scale local speculative decoding combines low-resolution drafter with learned up-samplers to propose candidate tokens, verified in parallel by high-resolution target model. Uses local rejection and resampling mechanism focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling.

Result: Achieves up to 1.7× speedup, outperforming EAGLE-2 and LANTERN baselines while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. Validated on MS-COCO 5k using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 metrics.

Conclusion: Sets new SOTA in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging efficiency and fidelity gap. Local rejection/resampling with neighborhood expansion is key innovation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, yet their sequential nature imposes significant latency constraints. Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging the gap between efficiency and fidelity.

TL;DR: VLI is a training-free inference framework that reduces object hallucination in multimodal LLMs through metacognitive self-correction, achieving SOTA performance on hallucination benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination undermines MLLM reliability due to models trusting linguistic priors over visual evidence. Existing methods are limited: contrastive decoding is superficial, and latent steering uses static vectors lacking instance-specific precision.

Method: VLI performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize causal visual anchors, then uses Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to modulate inference by isolating visual evidence from noise and neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration.

Result: VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.

Conclusion: VLI effectively addresses object hallucination in MLLMs through a training-free metacognitive self-correction framework that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Object hallucination critically undermines the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models, often stemming from a fundamental failure in cognitive introspection, where models blindly trust linguistic priors over specific visual evidence. Existing mitigations remain limited: contrastive decoding approaches operate superficially without rectifying internal semantic misalignments, while current latent steering methods rely on static vectors that lack instance-specific precision. We introduce Vision-Language Introspection (VLI), a training-free inference framework that simulates a metacognitive self-correction process. VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration. VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance on advanced models, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.

TL;DR: CoV prompting enables VLMs to actively explore 3D scenes for embodied QA by selecting relevant views and adjusting camera positions, improving spatial reasoning without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited to fixed input views, hindering their ability to gather distributed context and perform complex spatial reasoning in 3D environments for embodied question answering.

Method: Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting: training-free framework with coarse-to-fine exploration. First, View Selection agent filters redundant frames and identifies anchor views. Then, fine-grained view adjustment through iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions to gather sufficient context.

Result: Average +11.56% improvement in LLM-Match on OpenEQA across four VLMs (max +13.62% on Qwen3-VL-Flash). Test-time scaling: additional +2.51% improvement with increased action budget. Strong performance on ScanQA (116 CIDEr/31.9 EM@1) and SQA3D (51.1 EM@1).

Conclusion: Question-aligned view selection with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D embodied QA without additional training.

Abstract: Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.
  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.

TL;DR: VideoAuto-R1 introduces a "reason-when-necessary" framework for video understanding that only activates CoT reasoning when needed, achieving SOTA accuracy with 3.3x efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT reasoning in video models is computationally expensive and often unnecessary, as direct answering can match or surpass CoT performance despite the higher cost of step-by-step analysis.

Method: VideoAuto-R1 uses a "Thinking Once, Answering Twice" paradigm: during training, the model generates an initial answer, performs reasoning, then outputs a reviewed answer with both supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, it uses the initial answer's confidence score to decide whether to activate reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video QA and grounding benchmarks while reducing average response length by ~3.3x (from 149 to 44 tokens). Shows low thinking-mode activation on perception tasks but higher activation on reasoning-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit language-based reasoning is generally beneficial but not always necessary; the proposed reason-when-necessary strategy provides optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off for video understanding.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for multimodal large language models on video understanding tasks. However, its necessity and advantages over direct answering remain underexplored. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for RL-trained video models, direct answering often matches or even surpasses CoT performance, despite CoT producing step-by-step analyses at a higher computational cost. Motivated by this, we propose VideoAuto-R1, a video understanding framework that adopts a reason-when-necessary strategy. During training, our approach follows a Thinking Once, Answering Twice paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, then performs reasoning, and finally outputs a reviewed answer. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, the model uses the confidence score of the initial answer to determine whether to proceed with reasoning. Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens. Moreover, we observe a low rate of thinking-mode activation on perception-oriented tasks, but a higher rate on reasoning-intensive tasks. This suggests that explicit language-based reasoning is generally beneficial but not always necessary.

*Zuhair Ahmed Khan Taha,Mohammed Mudassir Uddin,Shahnawaz Alam*

TL;DR: AgentCompress reduces LLM computational costs by 68.3% while maintaining 96.2% success rate through intelligent task routing to compressed model variants based on difficulty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of large language models (e.g., $127 per session for 70B parameter models) make them inaccessible to many academic labs, limiting their use in autonomous research tasks like literature review and hypothesis generation.

Method: Uses a small neural network to assess task difficulty from opening words, then routes tasks to appropriately compressed model variants. The routing decision occurs in under 1 millisecond.

Result: Tested across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, achieving 68.3% reduction in compute costs while maintaining 96.2% of original success rate.

Conclusion: AgentCompress makes LLM-powered research tools more accessible to budget-constrained academic labs by significantly reducing computational costs with minimal performance impact.

Abstract: When researchers deploy large language models for autonomous tasks like reviewing literature or generating hypotheses, the computational bills add up quickly. A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate. For labs watching their budgets, this could mean the difference between running experiments and sitting on the sidelines

TL;DR: VLMs increasingly hallucinate by favoring textual prompts over visual evidence as object counts increase, but specific attention heads can be ablated to reduce these prompt-induced hallucinations by 40% without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models often hallucinate by prioritizing textual prompts over visual evidence, creating a reliability problem. The researchers wanted to understand this failure mode in a controlled setting where prompts overstate object counts.

Method: Used controlled object-counting experiments where prompts overstated actual object counts. Conducted mechanistic analysis of three VLMs to identify specific attention heads responsible for prompt-induced hallucinations, then performed ablation studies on these heads.

Result: Found that VLMs increasingly conform to incorrect prompts as object counts increase. Identified a small set of attention heads whose ablation reduces prompt-induced hallucinations by at least 40% without additional training. Different models implement prompt copying through different mechanisms.

Conclusion: Prompt-induced hallucinations in VLMs are mediated by specific attention heads that can be targeted for intervention. The findings reveal model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented, offering insights into internal mechanisms driving hallucinations and potential mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly capable, yet often hallucinate by favoring textual prompts over visual evidence. We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.

TL;DR: FlowLet is a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs using flow matching in an invertible 3D wavelet domain to improve Brain Age Prediction performance for underrepresented age groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D MRI datasets for Brain Age Prediction are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Current generative methods for data augmentation are slow, introduce artifacts, and rarely condition on age, affecting BAP performance.

Method: FlowLet uses flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain to synthesize age-conditioned 3D MRIs, avoiding reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands while enabling fast sampling.

Result: FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with FlowLet-generated data improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.

Conclusion: FlowLet provides an effective conditional generative framework for synthesizing age-conditioned 3D MRIs that addresses limitations of existing methods and improves Brain Age Prediction fairness and performance.

Abstract: Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in studying neurological development, aging, and diseases. One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can effortlessly anticipate object motions through interaction, but computational systems lack this ability. The paper aims to enable computational systems to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation, similar to human anticipation.

Method: ObjectForesight uses explicit 3D object-level representations rather than pixel or latent space. It leverages recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2M+ short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories for training at scale.

Result: ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes. It establishes a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable framework for learning object-centric dynamics models that can predict future object motions with geometric consistency and generalization capabilities, advancing toward computational systems with human-like anticipation abilities.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly anticipate how objects might move or change through interaction--imagining a cup being lifted, a knife slicing, or a lid being closed. We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io

TL;DR: PlenopticDreamer is a novel framework for multi-view video re-rendering that maintains spatio-temporal consistency in hallucinated regions through synchronized generative hallucinations and camera-guided video retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled generative video re-rendering methods (like ReCamMaster) struggle with multi-view consistency and spatio-temporal coherence in hallucinated regions due to generative model stochasticity.

Method: Trains a multi-in-single-out video-conditioned model autoregressively with camera-guided video retrieval to select salient videos from previous generations as conditional inputs. Incorporates progressive context-scaling, self-conditioning for robustness against error accumulation, and long-video conditioning for extended generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art video re-rendering on Basic and Agibot benchmarks, delivering superior view synchronization, high-fidelity visuals, accurate camera control, and diverse view transformations (third-person to third-person, head-view to gripper-view in robotics).

Conclusion: PlenopticDreamer successfully addresses multi-view consistency challenges in generative video re-rendering through synchronized hallucinations and adaptive retrieval strategies, enabling robust and coherent multi-view video generation.

Abstract: Camera-controlled generative video re-rendering methods, such as ReCamMaster, have achieved remarkable progress. However, despite their success in single-view setting, these works often struggle to maintain consistency across multi-view scenarios. Ensuring spatio-temporal coherence in hallucinated regions remains challenging due to the inherent stochasticity of generative models. To address it, we introduce PlenopticDreamer, a framework that synchronizes generative hallucinations to maintain spatio-temporal memory. The core idea is to train a multi-in-single-out video-conditioned model in an autoregressive manner, aided by a camera-guided video retrieval strategy that adaptively selects salient videos from previous generations as conditional inputs. In addition, Our training incorporates progressive context-scaling to improve convergence, self-conditioning to enhance robustness against long-range visual degradation caused by error accumulation, and a long-video conditioning mechanism to support extended video generation. Extensive experiments on the Basic and Agibot benchmarks demonstrate that PlenopticDreamer achieves state-of-the-art video re-rendering, delivering superior view synchronization, high-fidelity visuals, accurate camera control, and diverse view transformations (e.g., third-person to third-person, and head-view to gripper-view in robotic manipulation).

TL;DR: Visual identity prompting for diffusion-based robot manipulation data augmentation improves policy training by providing explicit visual guidance instead of just text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data is difficult to scale across diverse environments due to hardware and setup constraints. Existing text-prompt conditioned diffusion models overlook the need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations, and text prompts alone cannot reliably specify scene setups.

Method: Introduces visual identity prompting that supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide generation of desired scene setups. Builds a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets for data augmentation.

Result: Using augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.

Conclusion: Visual identity prompting addresses limitations of text-only conditioning for diffusion-based robot data augmentation, enabling more effective policy training through better scene specification and multi-view coherence.

Abstract: The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.

### [75] [GREx: Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation, Comprehension, and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05244)
*Henghui Ding,Chang Liu,Shuting He,Xudong Jiang,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GREx (Generalized Referring Expression tasks) that extend traditional RES/REC/REG to handle multi-target and no-target expressions, creates the gRefCOCO dataset, and proposes ReLA method for complex relationship modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Referring Expression (REx) datasets and methods only support single-target expressions (one expression refers to one object), which limits real-world applications where expressions can refer to multiple objects or no objects at all.

Method: 1) Introduces GREx benchmarks (GRES, GREC, GREG) that generalize REx to arbitrary numbers of objects. 2) Creates gRefCOCO dataset with multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions. 3) Proposes ReLA baseline that adaptively divides images into regions with sub-instance clues and models region-region and region-language dependencies.

Result: The proposed ReLA method achieves state-of-the-art results on both GRES and GREC tasks. The gRefCOCO dataset enables studying performance gaps of existing REx methods on generalized tasks.

Conclusion: GREx and gRefCOCO extend REx to more realistic scenarios with arbitrary numbers of objects, providing backward compatibility with existing REx while enabling research on multi-target and no-target expression understanding and generation.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) and Comprehension (REC) respectively segment and detect the object described by an expression, while Referring Expression Generation (REG) generates an expression for the selected object. Existing datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one object, not considering multi-target and no-target expressions. This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GREx.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometry foundation models suffer from flying pixels and loss of fine details, which is problematic for robotics and augmented reality applications that require clean, accurate geometry from images.

Method: 1) Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD): monocular depth foundation model using pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT) with Semantics-Prompted DiT (incorporating semantic representations from vision foundation models) and Cascade DiT architecture (progressive token increase). 2) Pixel-Perfect Video Depth (PPVD): extends PPD with Semantics-Consistent DiT (temporally consistent semantics from multi-view geometry models) and reference-guided token propagation for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models, producing significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.

Conclusion: Pixel-space diffusion transformers with semantic prompting and cascade architectures enable high-quality, flying-pixel-free geometry reconstruction, advancing the state-of-the-art for robotics and AR applications.

Abstract: Recovering clean and accurate geometry from images is essential for robotics and augmented reality. However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.

TL;DR: QNeRF: First hybrid quantum-classical model for novel-view synthesis that uses quantum circuits to encode spatial/view information, achieving comparable performance to classical NeRF with less than half the parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) advance novel-view synthesis but require large models and intensive training. Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) show promise for compactness and convergence speed. The authors aim to combine quantum advantages with NeRF capabilities for more efficient 3D scene representation.

Method: Introduces QNeRF with two variants: 1) Full QNeRF uses all quantum amplitudes for enhanced representation, and 2) Dual-Branch QNeRF separates spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations to reduce complexity and improve scalability. Both leverage parameterized quantum circuits with superposition and entanglement for encoding.

Result: QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines on moderate-resolution images while using less than half the number of parameters, demonstrating quantum machine learning as a competitive alternative for 3D representation learning.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive approach for continuous signal representation in mid-level computer vision tasks, particularly for 3D representation learning from 2D observations, offering model compactness advantages over classical methods.

Abstract: Recently, Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) have shown promising improvements in model compactness and convergence speed for learning the provided 2D or 3D signals. Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations.

TL;DR: Mesh4D: Feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction from video using skeletal-guided autoencoder and latent diffusion for one-shot animation prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular video need improvements in efficiency and accuracy for capturing complete 3D shape and motion of dynamic objects.

Method: Uses skeletal-guided autoencoder to learn compact latent space encoding entire animation sequences, with spatio-temporal attention for stable deformation representation. Then trains latent diffusion model conditioned on input video and first-frame mesh to predict full animation in one shot.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on reconstruction and novel view synthesis benchmarks, achieving more accurate 3D shape and deformation recovery.

Conclusion: Mesh4D enables efficient monocular 4D mesh reconstruction with skeletal guidance during training only, providing accurate shape and motion representation without requiring skeletal information at inference.

Abstract: We propose Mesh4D, a feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction. Given a monocular video of a dynamic object, our model reconstructs the object's complete 3D shape and motion, represented as a deformation field. Our key contribution is a compact latent space that encodes the entire animation sequence in a single pass. This latent space is learned by an autoencoder that, during training, is guided by the skeletal structure of the training objects, providing strong priors on plausible deformations. Crucially, skeletal information is not required at inference time. The encoder employs spatio-temporal attention, yielding a more stable representation of the object's overall deformation. Building on this representation, we train a latent diffusion model that, conditioned on the input video and the mesh reconstructed from the first frame, predicts the full animation in one shot. We evaluate Mesh4D on reconstruction and novel view synthesis benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in recovering accurate 3D shape and deformation.
