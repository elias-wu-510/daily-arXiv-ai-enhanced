TL;DR: FOFPred is a language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model that combines Vision-Language Model and Diffusion architecture for predicting future motion from noisy web-scale human activity data, with applications in robotic manipulation and video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations (like optical flow) is challenging, and learning from noisy real-world data remains underexplored. Optical flow offers immense value for control and generative tasks, but current methods struggle with generalizability and handling unstructured web data.

Method: FOFPred uses a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture that enables multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity. The model is trained on web-scale human activity data with crucial data preprocessing techniques and strong image pretraining to extract meaningful signals from noisy video-caption data.

Result: The trained model successfully tackles two distinct downstream tasks: robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings. Evaluations demonstrate cross-domain versatility, confirming the value of the unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

Conclusion: FOFPred establishes that a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture combined with scalable learning from diverse web data enables effective future optical flow prediction, with demonstrated versatility across control and generative domains.

Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

TL;DR: Adapted Sparse4D framework for large-scale infrastructure MTMC tracking using absolute geometric priors, occlusion-aware ReID, generative data augmentation, and hardware acceleration achieves SOTA HOTA 45.22 with 2.15× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transitioning autonomous driving models to static camera networks faces challenges from heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion in industrial infrastructure environments.

Method: Adapted Sparse4D framework with absolute world-coordinate geometric priors, occlusion-aware ReID embedding, generative data augmentation using NVIDIA COSMOS for Sim2Real bridging, and optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art HOTA of 45.22 on AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, with 2.15× speedup enabling single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

Conclusion: The adapted framework successfully addresses infrastructure MTMC tracking challenges through geometric priors, occlusion handling, domain adaptation, and hardware optimization for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object perception and multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking are fundamental for the digital transformation of industrial infrastructure. However, transitioning "inside-out" autonomous driving models to "outside-in" static camera networks presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion. In this paper, we present an adapted Sparse4D framework specifically optimized for large-scale infrastructure environments. Our system leverages absolute world-coordinate geometric priors and introduces an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module to maintain identity stability across distributed sensor networks. To bridge the Sim2Real domain gap without manual labeling, we employ a generative data augmentation strategy using the NVIDIA COSMOS framework, creating diverse environmental styles that enhance the model's appearance-invariance. Evaluated on the AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, our camera-only framework achieves a state-of-the-art HOTA of $45.22$. Furthermore, we address real-time deployment constraints by developing an optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation (MSDA). Our hardware-accelerated implementation achieves a $2.15\times$ speedup on modern GPU architectures, enabling a single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

### [4] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates three VLMs (GPT-4o, Florence 2, LLaVa-1.5) for construction worker action and emotion recognition from static images, finding GPT-4o performs best but all struggle with semantically similar categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robotics integrate into construction, understanding human behavior is crucial for safe collaboration. VLMs offer potential for recognizing worker actions and emotions without extensive domain-specific training, which is valuable in construction where labeled data is scarce.

Method: Evaluated three leading VLMs on a curated dataset of 1,000 construction site images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories. Used standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics including F1-scores and accuracy.

Result: GPT-4o performed best with average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 for action recognition, and F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 for emotion recognition. Florence 2 showed moderate performance (F1: 0.497 action, 0.414 emotion), while LLaVa-1.5 had lowest performance (F1: 0.466 action, 0.461 emotion). All models struggled with semantically close categories.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs provide baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction, but need improvements like domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing for real-world reliability.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [5] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OOD detection performance shows non-monotonic relationship with ID accuracy - improves initially but declines with advanced training recipes pushing accuracy beyond baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the under-explored link between OOD detection performance and modern training pipelines that maximize ID accuracy and generalization, as this interplay is crucial for robust ML systems in open-world settings.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study benchmarking 21 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained ResNet-50 models obtained via diverse training strategies, evaluated on eight OOD test sets.

Result: Contrary to common assumption, OOD performance shows non-monotonic relationship with ID accuracy - improves initially but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond baseline. Strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, with no single method universally optimal.

Conclusion: The study reveals complex relationships between training strategies, ID accuracy, and OOD detection performance, challenging the common assumption that higher ID accuracy always leads to better OOD detection, and highlighting the need for careful consideration of training-detector combinations.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [6] [Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854)
*Mohammad Rasras,Iuliana Marin,Serban Radu,Irina Mocanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reducing temporal information while increasing frame resolution affects 3D ResNet-based action recognition models, and tests various attention mechanisms to compensate for lost temporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between temporal information and spatial resolution in action recognition, and explore how attention mechanisms can help models perform better when temporal data is limited but frame resolution is increased.

Method: Created modified versions of three 3D ResNet models (MC3, R3D, R(2+1)D) with reduced temporal data but higher frame resolution, added dropout before final classifier, then developed ten variants for each with different attention blocks (CBAM, TCN, multi-headed attention, channel attention). Tested on UCF101 dataset.

Result: Best performance achieved 88.98% accuracy on UCF101 using modified R(2+1)D with multi-headed attention. Attention mechanisms showed varying effects on class-level accuracy despite similar overall performance improvements.

Conclusion: Missing temporal features significantly impact performance in high-resolution models, but attention mechanisms can partially compensate. Different attention blocks affect class-level accuracy differently, suggesting task-specific attention selection may be beneficial.

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

### [7] [Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880)
*Chongcong Jiang,Tianxingjian Ding,Chuhan Song,Jiachen Tu,Ziyang Yan,Yihua Shao,Zhenyi Wang,Yuzhang Shang,Tianyu Han,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical SAM3 is a domain-adapted version of the SAM3 segmentation foundation model, fine-tuned on large-scale medical imaging data to overcome domain shift limitations and enable robust prompt-driven medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3 shows strong generalization but performs poorly on medical images due to severe domain shifts, lack of spatial prompts, and complex anatomical structures. Vanilla SAM3's apparent competitiveness relies on strong geometric priors like ground-truth bounding boxes, which aren't available in real clinical settings.

Method: Full fine-tuning of SAM3 on 33 medical imaging datasets spanning 10 modalities, using paired segmentation masks and text prompts. This holistic adaptation goes beyond prompt engineering to acquire robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility.

Result: Medical SAM3 achieves consistent and significant performance gains across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities (2D/3D), especially in challenging scenarios with semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context.

Conclusion: Medical SAM3 establishes a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging, demonstrating that holistic model adaptation is crucial for robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [8] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrankenMotion: A diffusion-based framework for human motion generation with fine-grained part-level control using temporally-aware text annotations created via LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation methods lack fine-grained controllability over individual body parts due to absence of part-level motion annotations, limiting their ability to generate complex, asynchronous movements.

Method: Construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations using LLMs, then develop a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt.

Result: FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted for this setting and can compose motions unseen during training, demonstrating effective spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control.

Conclusion: This work provides the first atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and a model enabling fine-grained spatial and temporal control for human motion generation, with code and dataset to be publicly released.

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL-guided LDM generates synthetic DUV-FSM patches to overcome data scarcity, improving breast cancer margin assessment accuracy to 96.47%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast-conserving surgery needs precise margin assessment, but deep learning models for DUV-FSM imaging are limited by scarce annotated data.

Method: Proposed SSL-guided Latent Diffusion Model using DINO teacher embeddings to generate synthetic training patches, combined with real data to fine-tune Vision Transformer with patch aggregation.

Result: Achieved 96.47% accuracy and reduced FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines in 5-fold cross-validation.

Conclusion: SSL-guided LDM effectively addresses data scarcity in DUV-FSM imaging, enabling robust deep learning models for improved breast cancer margin assessment.

Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world autonomous systems face performance degradation from adverse weather conditions, requiring robust multi-task learning approaches that can adapt to visual perturbations.

Method: RobuMTL uses dynamic selection of task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad in a mixture-of-experts fashion based on input perturbations.

Result: On PASCAL: +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations, up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions. On NYUD-v2: +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks.

Conclusion: RobuMTL effectively improves robustness in multi-task learning for autonomous systems by adaptively handling visual degradation from adverse weather conditions through dynamic LoRA module selection.

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

### [12] [Sparse Data Tree Canopy Segmentation: Fine-Tuning Leading Pretrained Models on Only 150 Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10931)
*David Szczecina,Hudson Sun,Anthony Bertnyk,Niloofar Azad,Kyle Gao,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based models (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN) outperform transformer-based models (DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, DINOv2) for tree canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity (150 images).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree canopy detection is important for environmental monitoring, but real-world annotation scarcity poses challenges. The Solafune competition provides only 150 annotated images, creating a need to evaluate which architectures work best under extreme data constraints.

Method: Evaluated five representative architectures: YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNET, and DINOv2 on the small, imbalanced dataset. Analyzed training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under data scarcity constraints.

Result: Pretrained CNN-based models (YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN) generalized significantly better than transformer-based models. DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperformed due to differences between semantic/instance segmentation tasks, high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and lack of strong inductive biases.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation. Lightweight CNN-based methods remain most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery, confirming the importance of inductive biases and task alignment in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

### [13] [PatientVLM Meets DocVLM: Pre-Consultation Dialogue Between Vision-Language Models for Efficient Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10945)
*K Lokesh,Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri,Uday Agarwal,Apoorva Challa,Shreya K Gowda,Somesh Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCDF framework uses two VLMs to simulate doctor-patient diagnostic dialogues, generating realistic symptom data that improves diagnostic accuracy over image-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI medical diagnosis focuses on image analysis but lacks patient-reported symptoms, which limits diagnostic accuracy. Real-world diagnosis involves iterative questioning of patients, which current AI systems don't simulate.

Method: Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) with two VLMs: DocVLM generates follow-up questions based on images and dialogue history, while PatientVLM responds using symptom profiles from ground-truth diagnoses. The synthetic dialogues are clinically validated and used to fine-tune DocVLM.

Result: Clinical validation shows synthetic symptoms have clinical relevance, coverage, and realism. Fine-tuning DocVLM with dialogue-based supervision yields substantial improvements over image-only training, demonstrating the value of realistic symptom elicitation.

Conclusion: Simulating realistic diagnostic dialogues between VLMs generates valuable symptom data that significantly enhances diagnostic AI performance, bridging the gap between image analysis and patient-reported symptoms.

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

*Meidan Ding,Jipeng Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Haiqin Zhong,Xiaoling Luo,Wenting Chen,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMedExpert-R1 enhances medical VLMs with specialized reasoning through domain adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement, achieving SOTA on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MedVLMs excel at perception but struggle with complex clinical reasoning needed in real-world scenarios. Existing RL approaches face three critical mismatches: scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity.

Method: 1) Construct MMedExpert dataset with 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. 2) Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules for diverse initialization. 3) Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives. 4) Conflict-Aware Capability Integration merges specialized experts into a unified agent.

Conclusion: MMedExpert-R1 successfully addresses the limitations of current MedVLMs by combining domain-specific adaptation with clinical guideline reinforcement, creating a unified agent capable of robust multi-specialty reasoning alignment for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

*Xianliang Huang,Jiajie Gou,Shuhang Chen,Zhizhou Zhong,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDDR-NGP is the first unified method for removing various 3D scene distractors (snow, confetti, leaves, petals) from Instant-NGP representations, using implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors and novel losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on specific types of distractors, lacking a unified approach for removing diverse distractors like snowflakes, confetti, defoliation, and petals from 3D scenes. There's a need for a general solution that can handle multiple types of visual noise in 3D reconstruction.

Method: IDDR-NGP combines implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors to restore 3D scenes from corrupted images. It introduces two novel losses: Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) loss and Multi-View Compensation Loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize rendering results by aggregating information from multi-view corrupted images. The system is trained end-to-end.

Result: The method effectively removes multiple types of distractors from both synthetic and real-world scenes. It achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art desnow methods and accurately removes both realistic and synthetic distractors. A new benchmark dataset with annotated distractors was created to support research.

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP demonstrates the first successful unified approach for removing diverse distractors from 3D scenes using implicit representations, showing effectiveness and robustness across multiple distractor types and scene conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Method: Proposed AIGVDBench benchmark with comprehensive coverage of 31 state-of-the-art generation models, over 440,000 videos, and execution of more than 1,500 evaluations on 33 existing detectors across four distinct categories.

Result: The benchmark provides 8 in-depth analyses from multiple perspectives and identifies 4 novel findings that offer valuable insights for future research in AI-generated video detection.

Conclusion: AIGVDBench addresses current limitations in the field by providing a comprehensive, representative benchmark that offers a solid foundation for advancing AI-generated video detection research.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DDM+ improves video outpainting quality by fixing training-inference mismatch in mask strategy, enhancing visual fidelity and temporal coherence in challenging scenarios while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M3DDM suffers from quality degradation (spatial blur and temporal inconsistency) in challenging scenarios with limited camera motion or large outpainting regions where inter-frame information is limited. The root cause is identified as a training-inference mismatch in masking strategy.

Method: Proposes M3DDM+ which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training (instead of random masks), followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model to align training with inference requirements.

Result: M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency of the original framework.

Conclusion: Aligning training mask strategy with inference requirements through uniform masking and fine-tuning effectively addresses quality degradation in challenging video outpainting scenarios, making M3DDM+ a superior solution for practical applications.

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: A physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, addressing the gap in physical realism in transformer-based video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based video generation models lack physical realism, particularly in rendering rigid body motion and collisions. While physics-based simulators can model collisions using Newtonian formulas, modern video generation approaches discard object rigidity during pixel-level denoising and treat physical constraints as suboptimal conditions rather than strictly enforced rules.

Method: Introduces a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces. Extends this to a unified framework called Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle) that allows substantial fine-tuning while preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback.

Result: Constructs a new benchmark called PhysRVGBench and performs extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the approach's effectiveness in improving physical realism of generated videos.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm and MDcycle framework successfully address the physical realism gap in video generation by strictly enforcing physical collision rules rather than treating them as optional conditions, leading to more physically plausible video generation.

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDance is a novel Unbind-Rebind framework for character image animation that handles arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between reference images and driving poses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character animation methods struggle with arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between reference images and driving poses. Current approaches have overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment and cannot consistently rebind motion to intended subjects.

Method: Proposes CoDance with Unbind-Rebind framework: 1) Unbind module uses pose shift encoder with stochastic perturbations to break rigid spatial binding and learn location-agnostic motion representation; 2) Rebind module uses semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct motion to intended characters.

Result: CoDance achieves state-of-the-art performance on new CoDanceBench and existing datasets, showing remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The method handles arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on single, potentially misaligned pose sequences.

Conclusion: CoDance effectively addresses limitations of existing methods through its Unbind-Rebind framework, enabling flexible multi-subject character animation with robust handling of spatial misalignment and diverse character types. The approach will be open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based methods for 3D point cloud analysis often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas, which limit their effectiveness.

Method: Integrates a graph smoothing module to optimize graph structure by addressing sparse boundary connections and noisy junction connections, plus an enhanced local geometry learning module that uses shape features from adaptive geometric descriptors (based on eigenvectors) and distribution features from cylindrical coordinate transformation.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets show effectiveness in various point cloud learning tasks including classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of graph smoothing with enhanced local geometry learning addresses structural limitations of conventional graph-based methods and improves performance on multiple 3D point cloud analysis tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: VIGA is a vision-as-inverse-graphics agent that reconstructs/edit scenes through iterative execution and verification, achieving substantial improvements over one-shot baselines across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding needed for vision-as-inverse-graphics (reconstructing images as editable graphics programs). The key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification.

Method: VIGA uses a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure starting from an empty world. It combines (i) a skill library alternating generator and verifier roles, and (ii) evolving context memory containing plans, code diffs, and render history. The approach is task-agnostic and doesn't require auxiliary modules.

Result: VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines: 35.32% on BlenderGym, 117.17% on SlideBench, and 124.70% on the new BlenderBench benchmark. The system is model-agnostic (no finetuning needed) and works across diverse tasks including 3D reconstruction, scene editing, physical interaction, and document editing.

Conclusion: VIGA demonstrates that interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification enables effective vision-as-inverse-graphics, providing a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs across challenging graphics reconstruction and editing tasks.

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

TL;DR: SoLA-Vision is a hybrid attention backbone that strategically combines softmax and linear attention layers to achieve better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs than purely linear or rigid hybrid designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention has quadratic complexity O(N²) limiting high-resolution deployment, while linear attention reduces to O(N) but sacrifices modeling capacity and accuracy. Need better trade-off between efficiency and performance.

Method: Analytical study of linear vs softmax attention from layer-stacking perspective, systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns, and proposed SoLA-Vision with fine-grained layer-wise hybrid attention that strategically inserts global softmax layers.

Result: SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models on ImageNet-1K, and consistently surpasses strong baselines by considerable margins on dense prediction tasks while achieving better accuracy-computation trade-off.

Conclusion: Fine-grained layer-wise hybridization of softmax and linear attention enables superior performance-efficiency balance compared to rigid designs, with SoLA-Vision demonstrating strong results across vision tasks.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The massive computational and storage requirements of petabyte-scale satellite archives hinder widespread use and planetary-scale studies, creating barriers to democratizing Earth observation research.

Method: Transforms multi-sensor Landsat and MODIS observations into quantized latent vectors using ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), condensing annual phenological cycles into 12 temporal steps with ~340x data reduction.

Result: Achieves high compression (2.4 TB/year for global land surface) with strong reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543) and outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification (79.74% vs 76.92%).

Conclusion: ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research, enabling decadal global analysis on standard workstations and advancing next-generation geospatial AI with robust few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: A new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples using Rectified Flow models, offering faster computation and better structural alignment compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint generation of aligned samples either don't address structural alignment properly or use inefficient approaches like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) which is slow, prone to mode collapse, and produces cartoonish results.

Method: Uses Rectified Flow models operating on structured latent space with joint transport of segments in sample space. Built on top of arbitrary Rectified Flow models, enabling faster inference through joint transport approach.

Result: Demonstrates high structural alignment and visual quality for paired samples. Improves state-of-the-art for image and video generation. For 3D generation, achieves comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient, high-quality solution for joint inference of structurally aligned samples across multiple domains (image, video, 3D), overcoming limitations of previous approaches in both speed and alignment quality.

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current person ReID methods are typically scenario-specific and don't handle diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) in a unified framework. There's a need for a coherent approach that can leverage knowledge across multiple scenarios without requiring labeled data.

Method: Three-stage ITKM framework: 1) Fine-tune CLIP image encoder with scenario embedding for multi-scenario adaptation, 2) Optimize learned text embeddings with multi-scenario separation loss, 3) Use heterogeneous matching modules and dynamic text update strategy for reliable cross-modal alignment.

Result: ITKM outperforms existing scenario-specific methods across multiple scenarios and enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios, demonstrating superiority and generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed UMS-ReID task and ITKM framework successfully address multi-scenario person re-identification in an unsupervised manner, leveraging vision-language models to create a unified approach that generalizes across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

Method: Proposes a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. Uses joint optimization of instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency to anchor visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes.

Result: Outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. Demonstrates strong performance in explicit cross-lingual retrieval where query and target languages differ. Achieves this with only a fraction of parameters compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval, making it practical for edge deployment in digital archives.

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

*Cheng-Zhuang Liu,Si-Bao Chen,Qing-Ling Shu,Chris Ding,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTDMamba is a novel network for UAV video anomaly detection that addresses dynamic backgrounds through frequency decoupling and temporal dilation Mamba modules, achieving SOTA results on both static and new dynamic UAV datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAD methods focus on static backgrounds and struggle with UAV videos featuring dynamic backgrounds where object motion and UAV-induced global motion are coupled, leading to false positives and missed anomalies.

Method: Proposes FTDMamba with two components: 1) Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module to disentangle coupled motions via frequency analysis, and 2) Temporal Dilation Mamba Module using Mamba's sequence modeling to learn temporal dynamics and spatial structures across multiple temporal scales.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public static benchmarks and the newly constructed MUVAD dataset (222,736 frames, 240 anomaly events, 12 anomaly types), demonstrating effectiveness in both static and dynamic UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: FTDMamba effectively addresses UAV VAD with dynamic backgrounds through frequency-based motion disentanglement and multi-scale temporal modeling, with the new MUVAD dataset facilitating future research in this challenging domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Distill uses cross-architecture knowledge distillation from large ViTs to compact CNNs for data-efficient robotic manipulation, outperforming various encoder baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision Transformers (ViTs) have strong generalization but require massive data, while compact CNNs are easier to optimize in data-scarce robotic learning settings. There's a need to combine their strengths for practical robotic manipulation.

Method: X-Distill performs offline cross-architecture knowledge distillation: transfers visual representations from a frozen DINOv2 teacher to a ResNet-18 student on ImageNet, then fine-tunes the distilled encoder with a diffusion policy head on target manipulation tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on 34 simulated benchmarks and 5 real-world tasks show X-Distill consistently outperforms policies with from-scratch ResNets, fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders, 3D encoders using point clouds, and larger Vision-Language Models.

Conclusion: Simple cross-architecture distillation strategy enables state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation by synergizing ViT generalization with CNN optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

*Vishisht Sharma,Sam Leroux,Lisa Landuyt,Nick Witvrouwen,Pieter Simoens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) accelerates video segmentation on UAVs by reusing features from static regions, reducing latency 30% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oblique aerial video is crucial for rapid disaster response but processing is bottlenecked by UAV SWaP constraints, preventing real-time inference on edge hardware.

Method: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) formulates image patches as tokens, uses lightweight similarity metrics to identify static regions, and propagates precomputed deep features to bypass redundant backbone computations.

Result: On edge-grade hardware, TTR achieves 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible segmentation accuracy degradation (< 0.5% mIoU), validated on standard benchmarks and a new Oblique Floodwater Dataset.

Conclusion: TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions.

Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

TL;DR: SAMannot is an open-source local framework that integrates SAM2 for video instance segmentation with human-in-the-loop workflow, offering privacy-preserving, cost-effective annotation alternative to commercial platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video segmentation workflows face trade-offs between manual curation (labor-intensive), commercial platforms (costly), and cloud services (privacy-compromising). Research needs high-fidelity video instance segmentation but is hindered by manual annotation bottlenecks and privacy concerns.

Method: Integrates Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into human-in-the-loop workflow. Modified SAM2 dependencies and implemented processing layer to minimize computational overhead.

Conclusion: SAMannot offers a practical solution for complex video annotation tasks by combining foundation model capabilities with human oversight in a local, privacy-preserving framework that addresses resource constraints while maintaining high throughput and responsive interface.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASWiT is a dual-branch Swin-based transformer for semantic UHR image segmentation that addresses memory constraints by injecting global context into fine-grained features through cross-scale fusion and SimMIM-style pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with ultra high resolution (UHR) image segmentation due to quadratic memory growth with token count, which constrains either contextual scope or spatial resolution in remote sensing applications like aerial mapping.

Method: CASWiT uses a dual-branch architecture: context encoder processes downsampled neighborhood for long-range dependencies, high-resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches, and cross-scale fusion module combines cross-attention and gated feature injection to enrich high-resolution tokens with context. Also includes SimMIM-style pretraining with 75% masking.

Result: Achieves 65.83% mIoU on IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset (outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points) and 49.1% mIoU on URUR dataset (surpassing current SoTA by +0.9% under official evaluation protocol).

Conclusion: CASWiT effectively addresses memory constraints in UHR image segmentation by combining global context with fine-grained features through dual-branch architecture and cross-scale fusion, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on large-scale aerial datasets.

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

TL;DR: VLMs integrated with traditional CV and logic reasoning to enhance situational awareness through fine-grained event details, intelligent fine-tuning, and output justification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models can generate interpretable descriptions for situational awareness, but need improvements for identifying infrequent significant events with high reliability, accuracy, fine-grained details, and quality assessment.

Method: Integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning, with intelligent fine-tuning strategy and justification generation for VLM outputs during inference.

Result: Intelligent fine-tuning achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and provides means to confirm validity of VLM outputs or indicate why they may be questionable.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances situational awareness capabilities by combining VLMs with traditional CV and logic reasoning for better event recognition and reliability assessment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

*Mark Eastwood,Thomas McKee,Zedong Hu,Sabine Tejpar,Fayyaz Minhas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach for separating multiple chromogenic stains in multiplex immunohistochemistry RGB whole slide images, overcoming limitations of classical Beer-Lambert deconvolution for K>3 stains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Beer-Lambert color deconvolution becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC with more than 3 stains, creating a need for better methods to separate individual chromogen contributions in RGB histology images.

Method: Unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture: a compact U-Net encoder predicts K nonnegative concentration channels, and a differentiable Beer-Lambert forward model decoder with learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training uses perceptual reconstruction objective with additional loss terms to discourage unnecessary stain mixing.

Result: Excellent RGB reconstruction and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution on a colorectal mIHC panel with 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8).

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven approach effectively separates multiple stains in mIHC RGB WSIs, providing crisp per-stain concentration maps that outperform classical methods, with code and model publicly available.

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework combining UAV and street-view imagery with thermal infrared data to assess building-level heat exposure and identify heat-relevant building attributes in urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies heat exposure in Global South cities, but scalable methods for assessing heat-relevant building attributes are lacking. There's a need to identify household-level inequalities in heat exposure linked to building materials and socio-economic factors.

Method: Proposes a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) that fuses UAV and street-view imagery for cross-view learning of heat-relevant urban structure representations. Uses HotSat-1 thermal infrared measurements to quantify relationships between building attributes and heat-associated health risks.

Result: Dual-modality approach outperforms single-modality models by up to 9.3%. Identifies that vegetation around buildings, brighter roofing, and roofing materials like concrete/clay/wood (vs. metal/tarpaulin) are significantly associated with lower thermal infrared values. Successfully deployed in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Conclusion: The framework enables identification of household-level heat exposure inequalities linked to socio-economic disadvantage and building materials. Demonstrates the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment for equitable climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUG introduces a heterogeneous uncertainty-guided paradigm for composed image retrieval that addresses intrinsic noise in CIR triplets through fine-grained probabilistic learning with Gaussian embeddings and customized uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) suffers from intrinsic noise in triplets that creates uncertainty and threatens model robustness. Existing probabilistic learning approaches are insufficient because they use instance-level holistic modeling and treat queries and targets homogeneously.

Method: HUG uses fine-grained probabilistic learning with Gaussian embeddings for queries and targets. It customizes heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries (image+text) and uni-modal targets (images). The approach includes dynamic weighting for comprehensive query uncertainty and uncertainty-guided objectives with holistic and fine-grained contrasts using comprehensive negative sampling.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

Conclusion: The HUG paradigm successfully addresses limitations of existing probabilistic approaches for CIR through heterogeneous uncertainty modeling, leading to improved robustness and performance in composed image retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

TL;DR: SUG-Occ is a sparse learning framework for efficient 3D semantic occupancy prediction that uses semantic/uncertainty priors to reduce computation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving scene understanding but suffers from prohibitive computation and memory overhead, making real-time deployment challenging.

Method: Three key components: 1) Semantic/uncertainty guided sparse view transformation with unsigned distance encoding, 2) Cascade sparse completion module with hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling, 3) Object contextual representation mask decoder for lightweight query-context interactions.

Result: Outperforms baselines on SemanticKITTI benchmark with 7.34% improvement in accuracy and 57.8% gain in efficiency.

Conclusion: SUG-Occ successfully addresses the efficiency bottleneck in 3D occupancy prediction through explicit sparsity exploitation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness.

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

TL;DR: WetSAM is a SAM-based framework for wetland mapping using sparse point labels and satellite image time series, achieving 85.58% F1-score with minimal labeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wetland mapping requires expensive dense pixel-level annotations, while practical applications rely on sparse point labels where existing deep learning models perform poorly. Strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics make single-date imagery inadequate, and foundation models like SAM, though promising for point prompts, are designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands.

Method: WetSAM uses a dual-branch design: (1) a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and (2) a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels. Both branches are jointly optimized through bidirectional consistency regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight global regions (approximately 5,000 km² each) show WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%. The method delivers accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort.

Conclusion: WetSAM demonstrates strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping by effectively integrating temporal information with sparse point supervision through its innovative dual-branch architecture.

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches.

Abstract: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Wenxiao Li,Xue-Cheng Tai,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel framework integrates width information into topological structures for image segmentation, combining persistent homology with PDE smoothing to preserve both topological invariants (connectivity, genus) and dimensional properties (thickness, length).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topological definitions lack width information (thickness, length), limiting practical segmentation methods. Need to preserve both topological structures AND dimensional properties of image features.

Method: Integrates width into topological characterization using persistent homology + PDE smoothing concepts. Modifies local extrema of upper-level sets to embed width properties. Incorporates into variational segmentation models with proper loss functions and neural networks.

Result: Successfully preserves topological invariants (connectivity, genus counts) while retaining critical width attributes (line thickness, length). Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness in maintaining topological fidelity with embedded width characteristics.

Conclusion: Proposed framework overcomes limitations of traditional topological methods by explicitly integrating width information, enabling more practical and accurate image segmentation that preserves both structural and dimensional properties.

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Vision-Language Models lack explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning capabilities, making their decision-making processes opaque and difficult to understand.

Method: Two key components: 1) Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) integrates discrete grid for relational reasoning with continuous metric-scale representation for precise geometry. 2) Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT) performs explicit geometric reasoning using deterministic operations like vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues.

Result: Achieves 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching 60.9% baseline trained with full dataset. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets on VSI-Bench.

Conclusion: Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding through explicit spatial reasoning, demonstrating strong performance with reduced supervision and interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale livestock operations pose health and environmental risks and are vulnerable to threats like diseases and extreme weather. Accurate, scalable mapping of CAFOs is increasingly important as these operations grow.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) Detect candidate infrastructure (barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with domain-tuned YOLOv8, derive SAM2 masks, filter with component-specific criteria; (2) Extract structured descriptors (counts, areas, orientations, spatial relations) and fuse with deep visual features using lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier; (3) Output CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions linking decisions to visible infrastructure.

Conclusion: The infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline enables accurate, scalable CAFO mapping with interpretable results, addressing important environmental and public health monitoring needs.

Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show ho

TL;DR: MHA2MLA-VLM is a framework that efficiently converts existing vision-language models to Multi-Head Latent Attention architecture to reduce KV cache memory usage without expensive pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face significant memory and computational bottlenecks from growing KV cache during inference. While MLA compresses KV cache effectively, adapting existing VLMs to MLA without costly pretraining remains unexplored.

Method: Two core techniques: (1) modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that selectively masks nonessential dimensions for both traditional and multimodal settings, and (2) modality-decoupled low-rank approximation that independently compresses visual and textual KV spaces. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with output activation error minimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient way to adapt off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA architecture, addressing KV cache bottlenecks while maintaining performance and enabling further optimization through quantization.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

TL;DR: GeRo is a plug-and-play framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving by enabling joint planning and language-grounded future scene generation through autoregressive rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models for autonomous driving mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and underutilize their potential as generative models. There's a need for more comprehensive generative capabilities that can perform language-grounded reasoning about future traffic scenes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Train VLA model to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens with supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks. 2) GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation using multi-view images, scenario descriptions, and ego-action questions to generate future latent tokens and textual responses. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels to mitigate drift.

Result: On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score by +15.7 and success rate by +26.2. It achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance with strong zero-shot robustness when integrated with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Generative, language-conditioned reasoning shows promise as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving, enabling temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

TL;DR: ReScene4D enables 4D semantic instance segmentation in indoor scenes with sparse temporal observations, maintaining consistent instance identities across time without requiring dense measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor environments change over time with objects moving, appearing, or disappearing. Existing methods struggle: 3DSIS lacks temporal reasoning and requires discrete matching, while 4D LiDAR methods need high-frequency measurements uncommon in long-term indoor evolution.

Method: ReScene4D adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, using shared context for consistent instance tracking while also improving standard 3DSIS quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark. Introduces t-mAP metric that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency.

Conclusion: ReScene4D successfully addresses the challenge of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation, enabling consistent tracking of object instances across time in evolving indoor environments.

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D shape generation methods require clean, unoccluded inputs, which are unrealistic for real-world scenarios where data is casually captured with occlusions and clutter.

Method: Uses visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection, and vision-language models to extract sparse points, multi-view images, and captions. A rectified flow transformer conditions on these modalities with compositional augmentations, curriculum training, and clutter handling.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 2.7x improvement in Chamfer distance on a new benchmark of 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes.

Conclusion: ShapeR enables robust 3D shape generation from casually captured sequences, addressing real-world challenges through multi-modal conditioning and specialized training techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models struggle to unify visual understanding (semantic abstraction) and generation (pixel-level reconstruction) due to conflicting goals. Existing parameter-shared autoregressive architectures often compromise performance in one or both tasks.

Method: UniX decouples tasks into: 1) autoregressive branch for understanding, 2) diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation, with cross-modal self-attention to guide generation with understanding features. Uses data cleaning pipeline and multi-stage training strategy.

Result: Achieves 46.1% improvement in understanding (Micro-F1) and 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino) on benchmarks, using only a quarter of parameters compared to LLM-CXR. Performs on par with task-specific models.

Conclusion: UniX establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation by effectively decoupling tasks while enabling cross-modal collaboration through specialized architectures.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.
