  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable detection of small, fast-moving drones while maintaining energy efficiency in anti-UAV systems.

Method: Integrates frame-based and event-driven tracking, uses run-length encoding for event frames, adaptive mode switching, Fast Object Tracking Unit with adaptive thresholding, and custom NPU with zero-skipping MAC architecture.

Result: 2 mm² chip in 40nm CMOS achieves 96 pJ/frame/pixel, 61 pJ/event at 0.8V, 98.2% recognition accuracy across 50-400m ranges and 5-80 pixels/sec speeds.

Conclusion: Demonstrates state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems through integrated frame-event processing and optimized hardware.

Abstract: We present an energy-efficient anti-UAV system that integrates frame-based and event-driven object tracking to enable reliable detection of small and fast-moving drones. The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.

### [3] [SuperFlow: Training Flow Matching Models with RL on the Fly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17951)
*Kaijie Chen,Zhiyang Xu,Ying Shen,Zihao Lin,Yuguang Yao,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperFlow improves RL training for flow-based generative models by using variance-aware sampling for adaptive group sizes and step-level advantage computation aligned with flow dynamics, achieving significant efficiency gains and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for flow models has two main problems: (1) fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, leading to inefficient sampling and slower training; (2) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow.

Method: SuperFlow adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling to allocate more samples to important prompts, and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics, improving credit assignment.

Result: SuperFlow achieves promising performance using only 5.4% to 56.3% of original training steps, reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without architectural changes, and improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2% and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0% on T2I tasks.

Conclusion: SuperFlow provides an efficient RL training framework for flow-based models that addresses key limitations in current approaches, achieving both computational efficiency and improved performance on text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in flow-based generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) has improved text-image alignment and visual quality. However, current RL training for flow models still has two main problems: (i) GRPO-style fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, which leads to inefficient sampling and slower training; and (ii) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow. We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics. Empirically, SuperFlow reaches promising performance while using only 5.4% to 56.3% of the original training steps and reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without any architectural changes. On standard text-to-image (T2I) tasks, including text rendering, compositional image generation, and human preference alignment, SuperFlow improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2%, and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0%.

*Ellie Zhou,Jihoon Chung,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paper analyzes background bias in action recognition models and proposes mitigation strategies through segmented human input and prompt tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human action recognition models often rely on background cues rather than actual human movement and pose, exhibiting background bias that undermines true action understanding.

Method: Systematic analysis of background bias across classification models, contrastive text-image pretrained models, and Video Large Language Models (VLLMs). Proposed mitigation strategies include: 1) incorporating segmented human input for classification models, and 2) manual and automated prompt tuning for VLLMs.

Result: All analyzed models exhibit strong tendency to default to background reasoning. Segmented human input reduces background bias by 3.78% in classification models. Prompt tuning for VLLMs increases human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.

Conclusion: Background bias is pervasive across different types of action recognition models, but can be mitigated through targeted interventions like segmented human input and careful prompt design for VLLMs.

Abstract: Human action recognition models often rely on background cues rather than human movement and pose to make predictions, a behavior known as background bias. We present a systematic analysis of background bias across classification models, contrastive text-image pretrained models, and Video Large Language Models (VLLM) and find that all exhibit a strong tendency to default to background reasoning. Next, we propose mitigation strategies for classification models and show that incorporating segmented human input effectively decreases background bias by 3.78%. Finally, we explore manual and automated prompt tuning for VLLMs, demonstrating that prompt design can steer predictions towards human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.

### [5] [SCS-SupCon: Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Decision Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17954)
*Bin Wang,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCS-SupCon introduces a sigmoid-based contrastive learning framework with adaptive decision boundaries and style-content disentanglement to address limitations in fine-grained image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised contrastive learning methods suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, reducing discriminative power for fine-grained recognition tasks with subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations.

Method: Proposes Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon) with: 1) sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias for adaptive decision boundaries, 2) emphasis on hard negatives to mitigate negative-sample dilution, and 3) explicit style-distance constraint to disentangle style and content representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50: improves top-1 accuracy by ~3.9% over SupCon and ~1.7% over CS-SupCon. On fine-grained datasets: outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4-3.0 points. Statistical analyses confirm robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: SCS-SupCon effectively addresses limitations of existing contrastive learning methods through adaptive decision boundaries and style-content disentanglement, demonstrating superior performance and robustness for fine-grained image classification tasks.

Abstract: Image classification is hindered by subtle inter-class differences and substantial intra-class variations, which limit the effectiveness of existing contrastive learning methods. Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points. Extensive ablation studies and statistical analyses further confirm the robustness and generalization of the proposed framework, with Friedman tests and Nemenyi post-hoc evaluations validating the stability of the observed improvements.

### [6] [A Modular Framework for Single-View 3D Reconstruction of Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17955)
*Yuxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework using diffusion techniques for single-view indoor scene 3D reconstruction that splits the process into two steps: predicting complete views of room background/occluded instances, then transforming them into 3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches struggle with complex instance shapes and occlusions in indoor environments, often overshooting by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, resulting in limited reconstruction quality.

Method: A modular framework with four key components: 1) amodal completion module for restoring full views of occluded instances, 2) inpainting model for predicting room layouts, 3) hybrid depth estimation balancing geometric accuracy with detail expressiveness, and 4) view-space alignment method using 2D/3D cues for precise instance placement.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3D-Front dataset show the method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and room background from a single image and holds promising potential for applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality.

Abstract: We propose a modular framework for single-view indoor scene 3D reconstruction, where several core modules are powered by diffusion techniques. Traditional approaches for this task often struggle with the complex instance shapes and occlusions inherent in indoor environments. They frequently overshoot by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, which results in limited reconstruction quality. We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image. Extensive experiments on the 3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. The framework holds promising potential for applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality.

### [7] [Enhancing Tea Leaf Disease Recognition with Attention Mechanisms and Grad-CAM Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17987)
*Omar Faruq Shikdar,Fahad Ahammed,B. M. Shahria Alam,Golam Kibria,Tawhidur Rahman,Nishat Tasnim Niloy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated system using deep learning ensemble models with attention mechanisms to classify tea leaf diseases, achieving 85.68% accuracy on a novel dataset of 5278 images across 7 disease classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tea leaf diseases cause significant economic losses in the global tea industry. Manual identification is inefficient and unreliable, creating a need for automated systems to enable early detection and minimize crop damage.

Method: Developed a novel dataset of 5278 tea leaf images across 7 disease classes. Used pretrained models (DenseNet, Inception, EfficientNet) with attention modules to improve performance. Created an ensemble model combining these architectures and applied explainable AI for interpretability.

Result: The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.68% in classifying tea leaf diseases. The attention mechanisms improved model performance, and explainable AI provided better interpretability of the classification decisions.

Conclusion: The automated system successfully classifies tea leaf diseases with good accuracy, offering a practical solution for farmers to detect diseases early and reduce economic losses. The combination of ensemble learning, attention mechanisms, and explainable AI provides an effective approach for agricultural disease detection.

Abstract: Tea is among the most widely consumed drinks globally. Tea production is a key industry for many countries. One of the main challenges in tea harvesting is tea leaf diseases. If the spread of tea leaf diseases is not stopped in time, it can lead to massive economic losses for farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify tea leaf diseases as soon as possible. Manually identifying tea leaf disease is an ineffective and time-consuming method, without any guarantee of success. Automating this process will improve both the efficiency and the success rate of identifying tea leaf diseases. The purpose of this study is to create an automated system that can classify different kinds of tea leaf diseases, allowing farmers to take action to minimize the damage. A novel dataset was developed specifically for this study. The dataset contains 5278 images across seven classes. The dataset was pre-processed prior to training the model. We deployed three pretrained models: DenseNet, Inception, and EfficientNet. EfficientNet was used only in the ensemble model. We utilized two different attention modules to improve model performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.68%. Explainable AI was introduced for better model interpretability.

*Soumava Paul,Prakhar Kaushik,Ankit Vaidya,Anand Bhattad,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALIGN-Parts: A method for semantic 3D part segmentation that aligns 3D shapes with part descriptions via bipartite assignment, combining geometric, appearance, and semantic cues to create a unified part ontology across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D part segmentation datasets have inconsistent part definitions across different datasets, limiting robust training. Previous methods either produce unlabeled decompositions or retrieve single parts without complete shape annotations.

Method: Formulates part naming as a direct set alignment task. Decomposes shapes into partlets (implicit 3D part representations) matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment. Combines geometric cues from 3D part fields, appearance from multi-view vision features, and semantic knowledge from language-model-generated affordance descriptions. Uses text-alignment loss to ensure partlets share embedding space with text.

Result: Creates a unified ontology aligning PartNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Find3D datasets with 1,794 unique 3D parts. Introduces Tex-Parts dataset and 2 novel metrics for named 3D part segmentation. Enables zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions and confidence-calibrated predictions for known categories.

Conclusion: ALIGN-Parts provides an efficient, one-shot 3D part segmentation and naming method that supports open-vocabulary matching and serves as a scalable annotation engine for downstream applications.

Abstract: We address semantic 3D part segmentation: decomposing objects into parts with meaningful names. While datasets exist with part annotations, their definitions are inconsistent across datasets, limiting robust training. Previous methods produce unlabeled decompositions or retrieve single parts without complete shape annotations. We propose ALIGN-Parts, which formulates part naming as a direct set alignment task. Our method decomposes shapes into partlets - implicit 3D part representations - matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment. We combine geometric cues from 3D part fields, appearance from multi-view vision features, and semantic knowledge from language-model-generated affordance descriptions. Text-alignment loss ensures partlets share embedding space with text, enabling a theoretically open-vocabulary matching setup, given sufficient data. Our efficient and novel, one-shot, 3D part segmentation and naming method finds applications in several downstream tasks, including serving as a scalable annotation engine. As our model supports zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions and confidence-calibrated predictions for known categories, with human verification, we create a unified ontology that aligns PartNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Find3D, consisting of 1,794 unique 3D parts. We also show examples from our newly created Tex-Parts dataset. We also introduce 2 novel metrics appropriate for the named 3D part segmentation task.

### [9] [Seeing Justice Clearly: Handwritten Legal Document Translation with OCR and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18004)
*Shubham Kumar Nigam,Parjanya Aditya Shukla,Noel Shallum,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision LLMs for end-to-end handwritten Marathi text translation, focusing on legal document digitization for Indian courts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records (FIRs, charge sheets, witness statements) in India's district and high courts, especially for low-resource languages like Marathi with high handwriting variability.

Method: Comparison of two approaches: 1) Traditional two-stage pipeline (OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, then machine translation model translates it), and 2) Vision Large Language Models that perform direct end-to-end translation from handwritten text images.

Result: Evaluation on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, providing actionable insights for building robust, edge-deployable solutions.

Conclusion: The research aims to enable efficient legal document processing in low-resource environments and enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) and machine translation continue to pose significant challenges, particularly for low-resource languages like Marathi, which lack large digitized corpora and exhibit high variability in handwriting styles. The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike.

*Fakrul Islam Tushar,Ehsan Samei,Cynthia Rudin,Joseph Y. Lo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NodMAISI is a CT synthesis framework that generates anatomically-consistent lung nodules to address data scarcity in lung cancer screening, improving lesion detectability and malignancy classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets lack sufficient abnormal findings like small pulmonary nodules critical for lung cancer screening, and existing datasets have inconsistent curation and annotation.

Method: Anatomically constrained CT synthesis framework with: 1) standardized curation pipeline, 2) ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator based on MAISI-v2, 3) lesion-aware augmentation with controlled nodule mask perturbation.

Result: Improved distributional fidelity (FID 1.18-2.99 vs 1.69-5.21), substantially increased lesion detectability (especially for sub-centimeter nodules), and improved malignancy classification AUC by 0.07-0.21 under data scarcity.

Conclusion: NodMAISI effectively addresses data scarcity in lung cancer screening by generating anatomically-consistent synthetic nodules, improving both lesion detection and malignancy classification performance.

Abstract: Objective: Although medical imaging datasets are increasingly available, abnormal and annotation-intensive findings critical to lung cancer screening, particularly small pulmonary nodules, remain underrepresented and inconsistently curated. Methods: We introduce NodMAISI, an anatomically constrained, nodule-oriented CT synthesis and augmentation framework trained on a unified multi-source cohort (7,042 patients, 8,841 CTs, 14,444 nodules). The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion. In downstream nodule-level malignancy classification trained on LUNA25 and externally evaluated on LUNA16, LNDbv4, and DLCS24, NodMAISI augmentation improved AUC by 0.07 to 0.11 at <=20% clinical data and by 0.12 to 0.21 at 10%, consistently narrowing the performance gap under data scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture with CBAM attention and BiFPN feature pyramid improves small drone detection, outperforming newer Yolo versions in speed-accuracy trade-off, with knowledge distillation creating lightweight models for real-time deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drones pose increasing security risks but are difficult to detect due to small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast, requiring accurate real-time detection systems.

Method: Modified Yolov5 architecture (Yolov5-CBi) incorporating Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) for better small object detection, with four architectural variants and knowledge distillation for edge deployment.

Result: Yolov5-CBi outperforms newer Yolo versions (v8, v12) in speed-accuracy trade-off, with distilled model achieving 6.51% improvement over teacher (0.6573 vs 0.6171 mA@P0.5:0.9) and being 82.9% faster than baseline for real-time detection.

Conclusion: The CBi architecture with CBAM and BiFPN, combined with knowledge distillation, provides effective and efficient real-time detection of small UAVs, advancing drone detection capabilities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as, drones pose increasing risks in civilian and defense settings, demanding accurate and real-time drone detection systems. However, detecting drones is challenging because of their small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast. A modified architecture of YolovN called the YolovN-CBi is proposed that incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to improve sensitivity to small object detections. A curated training dataset consisting of 28K images is created with various flying objects and a local test dataset is collected with 2500 images consisting of very small drone objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, along with the local test dataset. The baseline Yolov5 and the proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture outperform newer Yolo versions, including Yolov8 and Yolov12, in the speed-accuracy trade-off for small object detection. Four other variants of the proposed CBi architecture are also proposed and evaluated, which vary in the placement and usage of CBAM and BiFPN. These variants are further distilled using knowledge distillation techniques for edge deployment, using a Yolov5m-CBi teacher and a Yolov5n-CBi student. The distilled model achieved a mA@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, representing a 6.51% improvement over the teacher's score of 0.6171, highlighting the effectiveness of the distillation process. The distilled model is 82.9% faster than the baseline model, making it more suitable for real-time drone detection. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed CBi architecture, together with the distilled lightweight models in advancing efficient and accurate real-time detection of small UAVs.

### [12] [FOODER: Real-time Facial Authentication and Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18057)
*Sabri Mustafa Kahya,Muhammet Sami Yavuz,Boran Hamdi Sivrikaya,Eckehard Steinbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOODER is a real-time radar-based framework that combines facial authentication via OOD detection with facial expression recognition, using low-cost FMCW radar to preserve privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe deployment of neural networks requires OOD detection to identify samples outside training domains. There's a need for privacy-preserving authentication systems that don't rely on cameras, and radar-based approaches offer a solution that protects user privacy while enabling facial authentication and expression recognition.

Method: Uses low-cost FMCW radar with range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. Authentication employs multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with BP and ILED components for OOD detection. Expression recognition uses ResNet block to categorize dynamic vs static expressions, then specialized MobileViT networks for each category classification.

Result: Achieves 94.13% AUROC and 18.12% FPR95 for authentication, with 94.70% average expression recognition accuracy. Outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and transformer-based architectures while operating in real-time.

Conclusion: FOODER demonstrates effective privacy-preserving facial authentication and expression recognition using radar data, offering a practical solution for secure, real-time applications without compromising user privacy.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time.

Motivation: Semantic segmentation for outdoor street scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, robotics, and assistive technology, requiring robustness to different environments, lighting, weather conditions, and sensor noise while maintaining real-time performance.

Method: Region-level, uncertainty-gated retrieval mechanism that selectively retrieves information only for uncertain regions rather than all regions, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Best method achieves 11.3% increase in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) while reducing retrieval cost by 87.5%, retrieving for only 12.5% of regions compared to 100% for always-on baseline.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-gated retrieval effectively improves segmentation accuracy and calibration under domain shift while significantly reducing computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of outdoor street scenes plays a key role in applications such as autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and assistive technology for visually-impaired pedestrians. For these applications, accurately distinguishing between key surfaces and objects such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, and pedestrians is essential for maintaining safety and minimizing risks. Semantic segmentation must be robust to different environments, lighting and weather conditions, and sensor noise, while being performed in real-time. We propose a region-level, uncertainty-gated retrieval mechanism that improves segmentation accuracy and calibration under domain shift. Our best method achieves an 11.3% increase in mean intersection-over-union while reducing retrieval cost by 87.5%, retrieving for only 12.5% of regions compared to 100% for always-on baseline.

*Thomas Boudras,Martin Schwartz,Rasmus Fensholt,Martin Brandt,Ibrahim Fayad,Jean-Pierre Wigneron,Gabriel Belouze,Fajwel Fogel,Philippe Ciais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SERA-H is an end-to-end deep learning model that generates high-resolution (2.5m) canopy height maps from freely available Sentinel-1/2 time series data (10m), supervised by high-density LiDAR data, achieving performance comparable to commercial very high-resolution imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for canopy height mapping face trade-offs between data accessibility and spatial resolution. There's a need for high-resolution forest mapping that uses freely available satellite data rather than costly commercial imagery.

Method: SERA-H combines a super-resolution module (EDSR) with temporal attention encoding (UTAE) in an end-to-end model. It's trained under supervision from high-density LiDAR data (ALS) to generate 2.5m resolution height maps from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series data (10m resolution).

Result: On an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H achieved MAE of 2.6m and R² of 0.82, outperforming standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines and achieving performance comparable to or better than methods using commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar).

Conclusion: Combining high-resolution supervision with spatiotemporal information from time series enables reconstruction of details beyond input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H enables free, high-frequency forest mapping with accuracy comparable to costly commercial imagery.

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of canopy height is essential for forest management and biodiversity monitoring. Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoStreamDepth: A real-time monocular depth estimation framework for endoscopic videos that produces accurate depth maps with sharp anatomical boundaries and temporal consistency across frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods for endoscopy often lack real-time processing, temporal consistency across frames, and sharp anatomical boundaries needed for downstream surgical applications like robotic surgery automation.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformation, (2) multi-level Mamba temporal modules for inter-frame information propagation, (3) hierarchical design with comprehensive multi-scale supervision using complementary loss terms for boundary sharpness and geometric consistency.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods on two public colonoscopy datasets, producing depth maps with sharp anatomically aligned boundaries and achieving real-time throughput.

Conclusion: EndoStreamDepth provides an effective solution for endoscopic depth estimation with real-time performance, temporal consistency, and sharp anatomical boundaries essential for supporting downstream surgical automation tasks.

Abstract: This work presents EndoStreamDepth, a monocular depth estimation framework for endoscopic video streams. It provides accurate depth maps with sharp anatomical boundaries for each frame, temporally consistent predictions across frames, and real-time throughput. Unlike prior work that uses batched inputs, EndoStreamDepth processes individual frames with a temporal module to propagate inter-frame information. The framework contains three main components: (1) a single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformation to produce accurate depth maps, (2) multi-level Mamba temporal modules that leverage inter-frame information to improve accuracy and stabilize predictions, and (3) a hierarchical design with comprehensive multi-scale supervision, where complementary loss terms jointly improve local boundary sharpness and global geometric consistency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two publicly available colonoscopy depth estimation datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods, EndoStreamDepth substantially improves performance, and it produces depth maps with sharp, anatomically aligned boundaries, which are essential to support downstream tasks such as automation for robotic surgery.

*Taewon Yang,Jason Hu,Jeffrey A. Fessler,Liyue Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D patch-based diffusion model for efficient high-resolution 3D CT reconstruction that learns from limited data by modeling joint distribution of position-aware 3D patches and downsampled global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct training of diffusion models on 3D data is computationally expensive and requires large datasets. Existing 2D diffusion priors fail to fully leverage generative capacity for 3D inverse problems like medical image reconstruction.

Method: Proposes a 3D patch-based diffusion model that learns 3D priors from limited data by modeling joint distribution of position-aware 3D local patches and downsampled 3D volume as global context, coupling local and global information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency, achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction of 512×512×256 (~20 minutes) across multiple CT datasets.

Conclusion: The method enables scalable generation of high-resolution 3D images and provides an efficient, accurate solution to high-resolution 3D inverse problems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Diffusion models learn strong image priors that can be leveraged to solve inverse problems like medical image reconstruction. However, for real-world applications such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, directly training diffusion models on 3D data presents significant challenges due to the high computational demands of extensive GPU resources and large-scale datasets. Existing works mostly reuse 2D diffusion priors to address 3D inverse problems, but fail to fully realize and leverage the generative capacity of diffusion models for high-dimensional data. In this study, we propose a novel 3D patch-based diffusion model that can learn a fully 3D diffusion prior from limited data, enabling scalable generation of high-resolution 3D images. Our core idea is to learn the prior of 3D patches to achieve scalable efficiency, while coupling local and global information to guarantee high-quality 3D image generation, by modeling the joint distribution of position-aware 3D local patches and downsampled 3D volume as global context. Our approach not only enables high-quality 3D generation, but also offers an unprecedentedly efficient and accurate solution to high-resolution 3D inverse problems. Experiments on 3D CT reconstruction across multiple datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency, notably achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction of $512 \times 512 \times 256$ ($\sim$20 mins).

TL;DR: AtlasSegFM is an atlas-guided framework that customizes foundation models for medical image segmentation with just one annotated example, improving performance especially for small structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive foundation models for medical image segmentation require precise prompts and underperform on underrepresented data in training. There's a need for lightweight, deployable solutions that can adapt to specific clinical contexts with minimal annotation effort.

Method: Two core innovations: 1) A pipeline that generates context-aware prompts via registration between a context atlas and query images, and 2) A test-time adapter that fuses predictions from both atlas registration and the foundation model.

Result: Extensive experiments across public and in-house datasets spanning multiple modalities and organs show consistent segmentation improvement, particularly for small, delicate structures.

Conclusion: AtlasSegFM provides a lightweight, deployable solution for one-shot customization of foundation models in real-world clinical workflows, making foundation models more practical for medical applications.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While recent interactive foundation models (e.g., nnInteractive) enhance generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining, they still depend on precise prompts and often perform below expectations in contexts that are underrepresented in their training data. We present AtlasSegFM, an atlas-guided framework that customizes available foundation models to clinical contexts with a single annotated example. The core innovations are: 1) a pipeline that provides context-aware prompts for foundation models via registration between a context atlas and query images, and 2) a test-time adapter to fuse predictions from both atlas registration and the foundation model. Extensive experiments across public and in-house datasets spanning multiple modalities and organs demonstrate that AtlasSegFM consistently improves segmentation, particularly for small, delicate structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MACE-Dance is a music-driven dance video generation framework using cascaded Mixture-of-Experts that achieves SOTA performance in both 3D dance motion generation and pose-driven image animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods from related domains (music-driven 3D dance generation, pose-driven image animation, audio-driven talking-head synthesis) cannot be directly adapted to music-driven dance video generation, and current approaches struggle to jointly achieve high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion.

Method: A cascaded Mixture-of-Experts framework with two specialized components: (1) Motion Expert uses a diffusion model with BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and Guidance-Free Training strategy for music-to-3D motion generation, (2) Appearance Expert uses decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning for motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both 3D dance generation and pose-driven image animation, with comprehensive evaluation on a newly curated large-scale dataset using a motion-appearance evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: MACE-Dance successfully addresses the challenge of jointly achieving high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion in music-driven dance video generation through its specialized cascaded expert architecture.

Abstract: With the rise of online dance-video platforms and rapid advances in AI-generated content (AIGC), music-driven dance generation has emerged as a compelling research direction. Despite substantial progress in related domains such as music-driven 3D dance generation, pose-driven image animation, and audio-driven talking-head synthesis, existing methods cannot be directly adapted to this task. Moreover, the limited studies in this area still struggle to jointly achieve high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion. Accordingly, we present MACE-Dance, a music-driven dance video generation framework with cascaded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The Motion Expert performs music-to-3D motion generation while enforcing kinematic plausibility and artistic expressiveness, whereas the Appearance Expert carries out motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis, preserving visual identity with spatiotemporal coherence. Specifically, the Motion Expert adopts a diffusion model with a BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and a Guidance-Free Training (GFT) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 3D dance generation. The Appearance Expert employs a decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in pose-driven image animation. To better benchmark this task, we curate a large-scale and diverse dataset and design a motion-appearance evaluation protocol. Based on this protocol, MACE-Dance also achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://macedance.github.io/

### [20] [Is There a Better Source Distribution than Gaussian? Exploring Source Distributions for Image Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18184)
*Junho Lee,Kwanseok Kim,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow matching with Gaussian source distributions has limitations in high-dimensional data generation. The paper proposes a 2D simulation to analyze flow matching dynamics, identifies key issues with density approximation and directional alignment, and introduces a practical framework combining norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling for improved performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While flow matching is a powerful generative modeling approach, the common use of Gaussian source distributions may not be optimal for high-dimensional data generation. The potential for better alternatives remains largely unexplored, and there's a need to understand the learning dynamics and limitations of current flow matching approaches.

Method: The paper proposes a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable setting to analyze flow matching learning dynamics. Based on insights from this analysis, the authors develop a practical framework combining norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. The pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. The proposed approach maintains robust omnidirectional supervision for stable flow learning while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design in flow matching models and introduces a readily applicable technique (directionally-pruned sampling) that can improve existing flow matching models without retraining. The findings highlight the importance of considering geometric properties and learning dynamics in generative modeling.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models.

*Janghyun Baek,Mincheol Chang,Seokha Moon,Seung Joon Lee,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALIGN improves 3D object detection by using LiDAR-image guided query initialization to handle occluded/crowded objects better than random or BEV-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query initialization strategies (random sampling or BEV heatmap-based) lead to inefficient query usage and reduced accuracy for occluded or crowded objects in camera-LiDAR 3D detection.

Method: Three components: 1) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE) integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics; 2) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS) generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering with supplemental sampling; 3) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB) balances queries between foreground/background.

Result: On nuScenes benchmark, ALIGN improves multiple state-of-the-art detectors by up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, especially in challenging occlusion/dense crowd scenes.

Conclusion: ALIGN provides effective occlusion-robust query initialization that enhances 3D object detection performance across various detectors in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recent query-based 3D object detection methods using camera and LiDAR inputs have shown strong performance, but existing query initialization strategies,such as random sampling or BEV heatmap-based sampling, often result in inefficient query usage and reduced accuracy, particularly for occluded or crowded objects. To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization. Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: A novel method using explicit graph representations for object parts improves object discovery and recognition in occluded/out-of-distribution settings, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implicit object representation methods fail to recognize learned objects in occluded or out-of-distribution contexts because they assume part-whole relations are implicitly encoded through indirect training objectives.

Method: Proposes a novel method that leverages explicit graph representations for parts and presents a co-part object discovery algorithm to address the limitations of implicit representations.

Result: Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in discovered object quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts.

Conclusion: The discovered object-centric representations can more accurately predict key object properties in downstream tasks, highlighting the method's potential to advance the field of object-centric representations.

Abstract: Discovering object-centric representations from images can significantly enhance the robustness, sample efficiency and generalizability of vision models. Works on images with multi-part objects typically follow an implicit object representation approach, which fail to recognize these learned objects in occluded or out-of-distribution contexts. This is due to the assumption that object part-whole relations are implicitly encoded into the representations through indirect training objectives. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method that leverages on explicit graph representations for parts and present a co-part object discovery algorithm. We then introduce three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of object-centric methods in recognizing multi-part objects within occluded and out-of-distribution settings. Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in the quality of discovered objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts. We also show that the discovered object-centric representations can more accurately predict key object properties in a downstream task, highlighting the potential of our method to advance the field of object-centric representations.

*Takuya OKi,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a quantitative framework to evaluate spatial openness in housing from 2D and 3D perspectives using Tokyo rental data, finding openness increased over time, correlates with higher rent, and interior design influences perception more than openness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spatial openness is crucial for improving residential quality and design, but existing studies often treat influencing factors separately rather than comprehensively.

Method: Used data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards. 2D openness computed via visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans. 3D openness derived from interior images analyzed using Mask2Former semantic segmentation model to identify walls, ceilings, floors, and windows.

Result: Found increase in living room visibility and 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics. Higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated. Existing impression score models only weakly related to openness, suggesting interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space.

Conclusion: Provides a new multidimensional data-driven framework for quantifying residential spatial openness and linking it with urban and market dynamics, offering insights for housing design and urban planning.

Abstract: Understanding spatial openness is vital for improving residential quality and design; however, studies often treat its influencing factors separately. This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. The impression scores predicted by the existing models were only weakly related to openness, suggesting that the interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space. This study offers a new multidimensional data-driven framework for quantifying residential spatial openness and linking it with urban and market dynamics.

*Aryan Chaudhary,Sanchit Goyal,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs show systematic left-first bias when describing horizontally concatenated images, prioritizing left content before right content in ~97% of cases, independent of language reading direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize systematic spatial processing biases in Vision-Language Models that remain largely unexplored, particularly biases in how VLMs process and describe spatial arrangements in images.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source VLMs, tested with neutral prompting conditions. Also examined an Arabic-finetuned model to test language reading direction influence, and investigated training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome.

Result: VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases across different architectures. The bias persists even in Arabic-finetuned models (right-to-left language), ruling out language reading direction as primary cause. Training dataset guidelines show no explicit left-first ordering instructions.

Conclusion: The systematic left-first spatial attention bias in VLMs reveals fundamental limitations in how current models process spatial information, suggesting architectural factors rather than explicit training instructions cause this bias.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding visual content, yet systematic biases in their spatial processing remain largely unexplored. This work identifies and characterizes a systematic spatial attention bias where VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content before right-positioned content in horizontally concatenated images. Through controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that this bias persists across different architectures, with models describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases under neutral prompting conditions. Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause. Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations in how current VLMs process spatial information.

### [26] [Joint Learning of Depth, Pose, and Local Radiance Field for Large Scale Monocular 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18237)
*Shahram Najam Syed,Yitian Hu,Yuchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint learning framework for large-scale photorealistic 3D reconstruction from monocular video that couples depth, pose, and radiance estimation to overcome scale ambiguity, pose drift, and scene capacity limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular 3D reconstruction fails in large-scale scenes due to three key issues: scale-ambiguous depth causes ghost geometry, long-horizon pose drift corrupts alignment, and single global NeRFs cannot model hundreds of meters of content.

Method: Three-component system: 1) ViT depth network with metric-scale supervision for globally consistent depths, 2) multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment layer refining poses in feature space using learned pyramidal descriptors, 3) incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy with on-the-fly allocation of hash-grid NeRFs when view overlap falls below threshold.

Result: Achieves Absolute Trajectory Error of 0.001-0.021 m on Tanks and Temples benchmark (18x lower than BARF, 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF) with sub-pixel Relative Pose Error, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU.

Conclusion: Metric-scale, drift-free 3D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera through joint optimization of depth, pose, and radiance estimation.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3-D reconstruction from monocular video collapses in large-scale scenes when depth, pose, and radiance are solved in isolation: scale-ambiguous depth yields ghost geometry, long-horizon pose drift corrupts alignment, and a single global NeRF cannot model hundreds of metres of content. We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera.

*Pan Ben Wong,Chengli Wu,Hanyue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SG-RIFE enhances real-time video frame interpolation by injecting semantic priors into flow-based RIFE, achieving diffusion-competitive quality with near real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based methods like RIFE offer high throughput but struggle with complex scenarios (large motion, occlusion), while diffusion-based approaches achieve superior perceptual quality but have prohibitive latency for real-time applications. There's a need to bridge this gap between speed and quality.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained RIFE backbone. Uses frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer for semantic priors, introduces Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress/refine high-dimensional features, and Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS metrics, achieves quality comparable to Consec. BB on complex benchmarks while running significantly faster. Semantic injection provides decisive boost in perceptual fidelity for flow-based methods.

Conclusion: Semantic consistency enables flow-based methods to achieve diffusion-competitive perceptual quality in near real-time, bridging the gap between real-time performance and high-quality video frame interpolation.

Abstract: Real-time Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has long been dominated by flow-based methods like RIFE, which offer high throughput but often fail in complicated scenarios involving large motion and occlusion. Conversely, recent diffusion-based approaches (e.g., Consec. BB) achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality but suffer from prohibitive latency, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec. BB on complex benchmarks while running significantly faster, proving that semantic consistency enables flow-based methods to achieve diffusion-competitive perceptual quality in near real-time.

TL;DR: SDCM network addresses hyperspectral object detection challenges by reducing inter-band inconsistencies and redundancy through spectral discrepancy and cross-modal semantic consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images provide high spectral resolution for recognizing subtle differences, but face challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to spatial differences across bands, sensor noises, and illumination interferences.

Method: Proposes SDCM network with three key modules: 1) Semantic Consistency Learning (SCL) module uses inter-band contextual cues to reduce band heterogeneity; 2) Spectral Gated Generator (SGG) filters redundant hyperspectral data based on band importance; 3) Spectral Discrepancy Aware (SDA) module extracts pixel-level spectral features to enrich semantic representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SDCM network effectively addresses hyperspectral inter-band inconsistencies and redundancy, achieving superior object detection performance through spectral discrepancy awareness and cross-modal semantic consistency learning.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images with high spectral resolution provide new insights into recognizing subtle differences in similar substances. However, object detection in hyperspectral images faces significant challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to the spatial differences in hyperspectral inter-bands and unavoidable interferences, e.g., sensor noises and illumination. To alleviate the hyperspectral inter-bands inconsistencies and redundancy, we propose a novel network termed \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{D}iscrepancy and \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal semantic consistency learning (SDCM), which facilitates the extraction of consistent information across a wide range of hyperspectral bands while utilizing the spectral dimension to pinpoint regions of interest. Specifically, we leverage a semantic consistency learning (SCL) module that utilizes inter-band contextual cues to diminish the heterogeneity of information among bands, yielding highly coherent spectral dimension representations. On the other hand, we incorporate a spectral gated generator (SGG) into the framework that filters out the redundant data inherent in hyperspectral information based on the importance of the bands. Then, we design the spectral discrepancy aware (SDA) module to enrich the semantic representation of high-level information by extracting pixel-level spectral features. Extensive experiments on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with other ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification dataset (APS) with 8,340 images from 17 seed categories across 18 Chinese archaeological sites, plus APSNet framework achieving 90.5% accuracy for automated seed classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional archaeobotanical seed classification relies on expert knowledge which is time-consuming and inefficient. There's a research gap in intelligent methods for ancient plant seed classification despite progress in other archaeological fields.

Method: Created APS dataset and designed APSNet framework with Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module to extract seed size information, and Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture for channel and spatial feature decoding.

Result: Achieved 90.5% classification accuracy, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate superior performance.

Conclusion: The work provides an effective tool for large-scale, systematic archaeological research by automating ancient plant seed classification, addressing the efficiency gap in traditional archaeobotanical studies.

Abstract: Understanding the dietary preferences of ancient societies and their evolution across periods and regions is crucial for revealing human-environment interactions. Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key "evidence" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%. This demonstrates that our work provides an effective tool for large-scale, systematic archaeological research.

*Mingcheng Ye,Jiaming Liu,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Loom is a unified diffusion-transformer framework for interleaved text-image generation that outperforms baselines by using language planning and efficient conditioning on prior frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for interleaved text-image generation lack temporal coherence, compositionality, and efficient long-horizon generation capabilities needed for tasks like style transfer, compositional synthesis, and procedural tutorials.

Method: Loom extends Bagel via full-parameter fine-tuning with an interleaved architecture that alternates textual and visual embeddings. It uses language planning to decompose instructions into stepwise prompts and frame embeddings, and conditions on sampled prior frames rather than concatenating all history.

Result: Loom substantially outperforms the open-source baseline Anole by 2.6 points on a 5-point scale across temporal and semantic metrics, and shows strong improvements over unified and diffusion editing baselines on a curated 50K interleaved tutorial dataset.

Conclusion: Loom provides a unified framework for interleaved text-image generation that achieves superior compositionality, temporal coherence, and text-image alignment for various applications including style transfer, compositional generation, and tutorial-like procedures.

Abstract: Interleaved text-image generation aims to jointly produce coherent visual frames and aligned textual descriptions within a single sequence, enabling tasks such as style transfer, compositional synthesis, and procedural tutorials. We present Loom, a unified diffusion-transformer framework for interleaved text-image generation. Loom extends the Bagel unified model via full-parameter fine-tuning and an interleaved architecture that alternates textual and visual embeddings for multi-condition reasoning and sequential planning. A language planning strategy first decomposes a user instruction into stepwise prompts and frame embeddings, which guide temporally consistent synthesis. For each frame, Loom conditions on a small set of sampled prior frames together with the global textual context, rather than concatenating all history, yielding controllable and efficient long-horizon generation. Across style transfer, compositional generation, and tutorial-like procedures, Loom delivers superior compositionality, temporal coherence, and text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that Loom substantially outperforms the open-source baseline Anole, achieving an average gain of 2.6 points (on a 5-point scale) across temporal and semantic metrics in text-to-interleaved tasks. We also curate a 50K interleaved tutorial dataset and demonstrate strong improvements over unified and diffusion editing baselines.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel VLM privacy protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation with visual consistency, and introduces VPI-COCO benchmark for fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM-based attribute inference attacks pose serious privacy threats when users share images on social media. Existing protection methods degrade visual quality or interfere with vision functions, failing to balance privacy protection and user experience.

Method: A protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under visual consistency constraints. Also introduces VPI-COCO benchmark with 522 images and hierarchically structured privacy questions for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: Method reduces Privacy Attribute Recognition (PAR) below 25%, keeps Non-Privacy Attribute Recognition (NPAR) above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively protects privacy while preserving user experience, demonstrating strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments, with VPI-COCO enabling fair comparisons of protection methods.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become widely adopted, VLM-based attribute inference attacks have emerged as a serious privacy concern, enabling adversaries to infer private attributes from images shared on social media. This escalating threat calls for dedicated protection methods to safeguard user privacy. However, existing methods often degrade the visual quality of images or interfere with vision-based functions on social media, thereby failing to achieve a desirable balance between privacy protection and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark patterns in UI design undermine user autonomy, and current regulatory approaches are reactive. There's a need for proactive, real-time detection technologies as platforms become more sophisticated.

Method: Created a proprietary dataset of 4,066 UI screenshots from 194 websites across six sectors, annotated with five dark pattern UI components. Applied transfer learning with YOLOv12x object detection model for real-time detection.

Result: Achieved 92.8% mAP@50 detection accuracy with 40.5 FPS inference speed, demonstrating practical real-time performance. Dataset publicly released for further research.

Conclusion: The proposed visual detection framework effectively addresses the need for proactive dark pattern detection with high accuracy and real-time performance suitable for practical deployment in online environments.

Abstract: With the accelerating pace of digital transformation and the widespread adoption of online platforms, both social and technical concerns regarding dark patterns-user interface designs that undermine users' ability to make informed and rational choices-have become increasingly prominent. As corporate online platforms grow more sophisticated in their design strategies, there is a pressing need for proactive and real-time detection technologies that go beyond the predominantly reactive approaches employed by regulatory authorities. In this paper, we propose a visual dark pattern detection framework that improves both detection accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, we constructed a proprietary visual object detection dataset by manually collecting 4,066 UI/UX screenshots containing dark patterns from 194 websites across six major industrial sectors in South Korea and abroad. The collected images were annotated with five representative UI components commonly associated with dark patterns: Button, Checkbox, Input Field, Pop-up, and QR Code. This dataset has been publicly released to support further research and development in the field. To enable real-time detection, this study adopted the YOLOv12x object detection model and applied transfer learning to optimize its performance for visual dark pattern recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high detection accuracy of 92.8% in terms of mAP@50, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 40.5 frames per second (FPS), confirming its effectiveness for practical deployment in online environments. Furthermore, to facilitate future research and contribute to technological advancements, the dataset constructed in this study has been made publicly available at https://github.com/B4E2/B4E2-DarkPattern-YOLO-DataSet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMPR is a unified multimodal place recognition framework that can handle arbitrary modality combinations (camera, LiDAR, radar) with a single trained model, addressing challenges of dynamic modality adaptation, robustness to missing/degraded modalities, and cross-sensor generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal place recognition (MPR) is crucial for autonomous vehicles in GPS-denied environments, but existing methods struggle with: 1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs, 2) maintaining robustness with missing/degraded modalities, and 3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations.

Method: UniMPR unifies all inputs in a polar BEV feature space, uses a multi-branch network to extract discriminative intra-modal and inter-modal features from any modality combination, constructs large-scale training from multiple datasets, and employs adaptive label assignment for extensive pre-training.

Result: Experiments on seven datasets show UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: UniMPR provides a unified solution for multimodal place recognition that can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities with a single trained model, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Place recognition is a critical component of autonomous vehicles and robotics, enabling global localization in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions. Our code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/UniMPR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PACGNet introduces a pyramidal adaptive cross-gating network for aerial object detection that addresses cross-modal noise and preserves feature hierarchy through symmetrical cross-gating and pyramidal feature-aware multimodal gating modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial object detection methods rely on simple fusion strategies that are prone to cross-modal noise and disrupt the hierarchical structure of feature pyramids, impairing fine-grained detection of small objects.

Method: Proposes PACGNet with two core components: 1) Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module for bidirectional, symmetrical horizontal gating to selectively absorb complementary information while suppressing noise, and 2) Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module that reconstructs feature hierarchy via progressive hierarchical gating, using detailed features from higher-resolution levels to guide fusion at lower-resolution levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets with mAP50 scores of 81.7% and 82.1% respectively.

Conclusion: PACGNet effectively addresses cross-modal noise and preserves feature hierarchy in aerial object detection, enabling superior fine-grained detection of small objects through deep fusion within the backbone architecture.

Abstract: Object detection in aerial imagery is a critical task in applications such as UAV reconnaissance. Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical "horizontal" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 81.7% and 82.1% respectively.

TL;DR: MatE generates tileable PBR materials from a single unconstrained real-world image using depth-based rectification and a dual-branch diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PBR material creation requires specialized equipment and expert post-processing, creating a bottleneck in graphics pipelines. The authors aim to democratize this process by enabling material generation from casual real-world images.

Method: Given an image and user mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using estimated depth as geometric prior, then uses a dual-branch diffusion model that leverages learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data to rectify residual distortions and generate complete material maps (albedo, normal, roughness, height).

Result: The framework achieves invariance to unknown illumination and perspective, recovering intrinsic material properties from casual captures. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: MatE enables users to create realistic PBR materials from real-world images, democratizing material creation by eliminating the need for specialized equipment and expert processing.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity, physically-based rendering (PBR) materials remains a bottleneck in many graphics pipelines, typically requiring specialized equipment and expert-driven post-processing. To democratize this process, we present MatE, a novel method for generating tileable PBR materials from a single image taken under unconstrained, real-world conditions. Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model. Leveraging a learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data, this model further rectify residual distortions from the coarse result and translate it into a complete set of material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness and height. Our framework achieves invariance to the unknown illumination and perspective of the input image, allowing for the recovery of intrinsic material properties from casual captures. Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach, enabling users to create realistic materials from real-world image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that fuses 2D material predictions from diffusion models into 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructions for accurate, relightable scene assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual material modeling is time-consuming, and while 3D reconstruction captures geometry, it lacks precise material parameters needed for relighting. 2D diffusion models can predict PBR materials but transferring them to 3D geometry remains challenging.

Method: 1) Reconstruct scene geometry using Gaussian Splatting. 2) Generate 2D PBR material maps (albedo, roughness, metallic) from input images using diffusion models. 3) Fuse materials into 3D via optimization or direct projection using Gaussian ray tracing. 4) Refine with Neural Merger for fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency.

Result: Outperforms existing techniques in quantitative metrics and visual realism, enabling more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows by effectively bridging 2D material prediction with 3D geometry reconstruction.

Abstract: Manual modeling of material parameters and 3D geometry is a time consuming yet essential task in the gaming and film industries. While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines.

Conclusion: BoNet+ model enables automated, high-precision, objective bone age assessment while reducing clinical workload through effective integration of global and local skeletal features.

Abstract: Bone Age Assessment (BAA) is a widely used clinical technique that can accurately reflect an individual's growth and development level, as well as maturity. In recent years, although deep learning has advanced the field of bone age assessment, existing methods face challenges in efficiently balancing global features and local skeletal details. This study aims to develop an automated bone age assessment system based on a two-stream deep learning architecture to achieve higher accuracy in bone age assessment. We propose the BoNet+ model incorporating global and local feature extraction channels. A Transformer module is introduced into the global feature extraction channel to enhance the ability in extracting global features through multi-head self-attention mechanism. A RFAConv module is incorporated into the local feature extraction channel to generate adaptive attention maps within multiscale receptive fields, enhancing local feature extraction capabilities. Global and local features are concatenated along the channel dimension and optimized by an Inception-V3 network. The proposed method has been validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) test datasets, achieving mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.81 and 5.65 months, respectively. These results are comparable to the state-of-the-art. The BoNet+ model reduces the clinical workload and achieves automatic, high-precision, and more objective bone age assessment.

Result: Achieves average R2 of 0.8123 (RMSE 0.4796) for LAI and 0.6846 (RMSE 2.4222) for SPAD, surpassing baselines by 8.95% LAI R2 and 8.17% SPAD R2 improvement, with only 0.10M parameters and high inference speed.

Conclusion: Integration of semi-supervised learning with agronomic priors provides a promising approach for enhancing remote sensing-based precision agriculture, addressing key limitations in winter wheat monitoring.

Abstract: Vegetation index (VI) saturation during the dense canopy stage and limited ground-truth annotations of winter wheat constrain accurate estimation of LAI and SPAD. Existing VI-based and texture-driven machine learning methods exhibit limited feature expressiveness. In addition, deep learning baselines suffer from domain gaps and high data demands, which restrict their generalization. Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization. Datasets were partitioned using a vegetation height-informed strategy to maintain representativeness across growth stages. Experiments over 10 repeated runs demonstrate that MCVI-SANet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters. Overall, the integration of semi-supervised learning with agronomic priors provides a promising approach for enhancing remote sensing-based precision agriculture.

TL;DR: Proposes a new efficient Gaussian posterior transition method for zero-shot diffusion-based image editing that avoids backpropagation through denoiser networks, reducing memory/runtime overhead while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot diffusion methods for image editing rely on surrogate likelihood functions requiring vector-Jacobian products through denoiser networks at every reverse step, causing significant memory and runtime overhead.

Method: Proposes a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping backpropagation through the denoiser network.

Result: Achieves strong observation consistency compared with fine-tuned baselines, produces coherent high-quality reconstructions, while significantly reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient alternative to existing zero-shot diffusion approaches for image editing, maintaining quality while dramatically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for image editing tasks such as inpainting and local modification, where the objective is to generate realistic content that remains consistent with observed regions. In particular, zero-shot approaches that leverage a pretrained diffusion model, without any retraining, have been shown to achieve highly effective reconstructions. However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping the backpropagation through the denoiser network. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves strong observation consistency compared with fine-tuned baselines and produces coherent, high-quality reconstructions, all while significantly reducing inference cost.

*Wenhao Hu,Haonan Zhou,Zesheng Li,Liu Liu,Jiacheng Dong,Zhizhong Su,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RecurGS is a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving 3D representation capable of interaction, supporting object-level manipulation and novel state synthesis without additional scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene representation approaches have limitations: they either focus on updating single scenes without supporting novel-state synthesis, or rely on diffusion-based methods that work on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. There's a need for systems that can handle discrete scene changes and construct interactive 3D environments.

Method: RecurGS uses a recurrent fusion framework that: 1) detects object-level changes across consecutive states, 2) aligns geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, 3) performs recurrent updates with replay supervision to preserve historical structures, and 4) employs a voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module that selectively incorporates new observations while keeping stable areas fixed.

Result: The framework supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments, and demonstrates high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency in experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RecurGS provides a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds by enabling efficient long-horizon updates while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, addressing key challenges in adapting to discrete scene changes and constructing interactive 3D environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene representations have enabled high-fidelity novel view synthesis, yet adapting to discrete scene changes and constructing interactive 3D environments remain open challenges in vision and robotics. Existing approaches focus solely on updating a single scene without supporting novel-state synthesis. Others rely on diffusion-based object-background decoupling that works on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework delivers high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency, providing a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned SAM 2 model achieves state-of-the-art performance for mosaic tesserae segmentation, with significant improvements in IoU, Recall, and F-measure metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mosaics are fragile cultural heritage artifacts that need digital preservation through accurate segmentation of tesserae from background, but existing datasets and methods are limited.

Method: Leverage Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) foundation model and fine-tune it using a newly created annotated dataset of mosaic images specifically for tesserae segmentation.

Result: Fine-tuned SAM 2 improves IoU from 89.00% to 91.02%, Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%, achieves 3% higher F-measure than previous methods, and reduces tesserae count error from 0.20 to 0.02.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned SAM 2 model combined with the new annotated dataset enables accurate real-time mosaic segmentation, advancing digital preservation of cultural heritage.

Abstract: Art is widely recognized as a reflection of civilization and mosaics represent an important part of cultural heritage. Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive. Due to their age and fragility, they are prone to damage, highlighting the need for digital preservation. This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images.

*Dimitrios Georgoulopoulos,Nikolaos Chaidos,Angeliki Dimitriou,Giorgos Stamou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISm is a novel multimodal framework for image-to-image retrieval that uses importance prediction on semantic graphs to capture relational and contextual scene nuances, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image retrieval methods fail to capture relational and contextual scene nuances, limiting their ability to find semantically similar images that align with human perception.

Method: Two key components: 1) Importance Prediction Module that identifies and retains critical objects/relational triplets while pruning irrelevant elements, and 2) Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network that encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed embeddings.

Result: Consistently superior top-ranked performance on benchmark and real-world datasets, with qualitative analyses showing accurate capture of key objects and interactions, producing interpretable and semantically meaningful results.

Conclusion: PRISm advances image retrieval by explicitly modeling semantic importance of objects and their interactions, combining relational reasoning with visual representation to achieve retrieval that closely aligns with human perception.

Abstract: Accurately retrieving images that are semantically similar remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as traditional methods often fail to capture the relational and contextual nuances of a scene. We introduce PRISm (Pruning-based Image Retrieval via Importance Prediction on Semantic Graphs), a multimodal framework that advances image-to-image retrieval through two novel components. First, the Importance Prediction Module identifies and retains the most critical objects and relational triplets within an image while pruning irrelevant elements. Second, the Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network explicitly encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed image embeddings. PRISm achieves image retrieval that closely aligns with human perception by explicitly modeling the semantic importance of objects and their interactions, capabilities largely absent in prior approaches. Its architecture effectively combines relational reasoning with visual representation, enabling semantically grounded retrieval. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate consistently superior top-ranked performance, while qualitative analyses show that PRISm accurately captures key objects and interactions, producing interpretable and semantically meaningful results.

*Fei Song,Yi Li,Jiangmeng Li,Rui Wang,Changwen Zheng,Fanjiang Xu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AmPLe addresses model-prompt and sample-prompt matching biases in multi-prompt learning through adaptive debiased ensemble weighting guided by information theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-prompt learning methods overlook two critical biases: (1) model-prompt matching bias where the same prompt conveys different semantics across different vision-language models, and (2) sample-prompt matching bias caused by prompt-irrelevant semantics in input samples, both hindering optimal performance.

Method: Proposes Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning (AmPLe) that uses ensemble learning to aggregate diverse predictions while extracting prompt-relevant semantics from input samples via information theory-based analysis to calculate adaptive debiased ensemble weights.

Result: Extensive experiments on generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts show AmPLe widely outperforms existing methods, with theoretical validation from a causal perspective supporting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AmPLe successfully mitigates both model-prompt and sample-prompt matching biases simultaneously, achieving superior performance across diverse downstream tasks with limited resources through adaptive debiased ensemble learning.

Abstract: Multi-prompt learning methods have emerged as an effective approach for facilitating the rapid adaptation of vision-language models to downstream tasks with limited resources. Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods. Theoretical validation from a causal perspective further supports the effectiveness of AmPLe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monochrome event-based cameras lack color information and struggle with static/slow-moving objects, limiting their applications despite their high speed and efficiency advantages.

Method: Integrates Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector with monochrome event-based camera to form Active Structured Light system. Uses dynamic projection adjustments to optimize bandwidth and enable separate color and depth detection for each pixel.

Result: Achieves color detection at 1400 fps and pixel depth detection at 4 kHz, producing colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. System enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications.

Conclusion: The integration of event-based cameras with projection-based techniques successfully addresses limitations of traditional ECs, enabling high-speed color and depth sensing with broad applications in robotics and 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (ECs) have emerged as bio-inspired sensors that report pixel brightness changes asynchronously, offering unmatched speed and efficiency in vision sensing. Despite their high dynamic range, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational simplicity, traditional monochrome ECs face limitations in detecting static or slowly moving objects and lack color information essential for certain applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach that integrates a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, forming Active Structured Light (ASL) for RGB-D sensing. By combining the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques, our method enables the detection of color and the depth of each pixel separately. Dynamic projection adjustments optimize bandwidth, ensuring selective color data acquisition and yielding colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. This integration, facilitated by a commercial TI LightCrafter 4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, not only enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications but also achieves remarkable performance milestones. With our approach, we achieved a color detection speed equivalent to 1400 fps and 4 kHz of pixel depth detection, significantly advancing the realm of computer vision across diverse fields from robotics to 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: MeniMV is a multi-view MRI dataset for grading meniscal horn tears with 3,000 exams, 6,000 co-registered sagittal/coronal images, and four-tier severity labels for anterior/posterior horns, enabling better automated diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated MRI analysis methods lack precise localization and severity grading for meniscal horn tears, relying on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, which doesn't capture the nuanced diagnostic information needed in clinical practice.

Method: Created MeniMV dataset with 3,000 knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam has four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians. Benchmarked multiple CNN and Transformer-based models on this dataset.

Result: MeniMV offers more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of prior datasets and uniquely captures dual-view diagnostic context. Established strong baselines for severity grading and highlighted challenges in automated musculoskeletal imaging.

Conclusion: MeniMV provides a valuable benchmark dataset for automated meniscal horn tear grading, addressing limitations of existing methods and offering a foundation for future research in musculoskeletal imaging analysis.

Abstract: Precise grading of meniscal horn tears is critical in knee injury diagnosis but remains underexplored in automated MRI analysis. Existing methods often rely on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, lacking localization and severity information. In this paper, we introduce MeniMV, a multi-view benchmark dataset specifically designed for horn-specific meniscus injury grading. MeniMV comprises 3,000 annotated knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam is meticulously annotated with four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians. Notably, MeniMV offers more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of prior datasets while uniquely capturing the dual-view diagnostic context essential in clinical practice. To demonstrate the utility of MeniMV, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based models. Our extensive experiments establish strong baselines and highlight challenges in severity grading, providing a valuable foundation for future research in automated musculoskeletal imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-centric video moment retrieval using scene graphs and relational tracklet transformers to capture fine-grained object semantics and temporal dynamics for better localization of object-oriented queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video moment retrieval methods rely on global frame/clip features that fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. Temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked.

Method: 1) Extract query-relevant objects using scene graph parser; 2) Generate scene graphs from video frames to represent objects and relationships; 3) Construct object-level feature sequences encoding visual/semantic information; 4) Process sequences with relational tracklet transformer to model spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across three benchmarks: Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and TACoS.

Conclusion: Explicitly capturing object-level state changes enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries, addressing limitations of global feature-based approaches.

Abstract: Most existing video moment retrieval methods rely on temporal sequences of frame- or clip-level features that primarily encode global visual and semantic information. However, such representations often fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships. Based on the scene graphs, we construct object-level feature sequences that encode rich visual and semantic information. These sequences are processed by a relational tracklet transformer, which models spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time. By explicitly capturing object-level state changes, our framework enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks: Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and TACoS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks.

*Tianyang Zhanng,Xinxing Cheng,Jun Cheng,Shaoming Zheng,He Zhao,Huazhu Fu,Alejandro F Frangi,Jiang Liu,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Plasticine is the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework with pixel-level traceability for medical images, combining intensity translation and spatial transformation in a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain gaps in medical imaging from device variations and population differences challenge ML models. Existing translation methods generate synthetic data but lack spatial correspondence traceability, which is crucial for clinical interpretability and trust.

Method: Plasticine combines intensity translation and spatial transformation within a denoising diffusion framework. It enables interpretable intensity transitions and spatially coherent deformations while maintaining pixel-wise traceability throughout translation.

Result: The method generates synthetic images with both anatomical variations and interpretable pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, supporting clinical traceability.

Conclusion: Plasticine addresses the critical need for traceable image translation in medical applications, providing both synthetic data generation and clinical interpretability through pixel-level correspondence preservation.

Abstract: Domain gaps arising from variations in imaging devices and population distributions pose significant challenges for machine learning in medical image analysis. Existing image-to-image translation methods primarily aim to learn mappings between domains, often generating diverse synthetic data with variations in anatomical scale and shape, but they usually overlook spatial correspondence during the translation process. For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective. Our method combines intensity translation and spatial transformation within a denoising diffusion framework. This design enables the generation of synthetic images with interpretable intensity transitions and spatially coherent deformations, supporting pixel-wise traceability throughout the translation process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive-VoCo enhances VoCo-LLaMA with adaptive visual token compression using a lightweight predictor that dynamically selects optimal compression rates based on image complexity, improving efficiency and performance over fixed-rate baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VoCo-LLaMA reduces computational costs by compressing visual patch tokens, its fixed compression rate cannot adapt to varying levels of visual complexity in different images, limiting efficiency and performance optimization.

Method: Proposes Adaptive-VoCo framework with a lightweight predictor that dynamically selects optimal compression rates by quantifying image complexity using statistical cues (patch token entropy and attention map variance) from the vision encoder, combined with a joint loss function integrating rate regularization and complexity alignment.

Result: Experimental results show consistent outperformance over fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, demonstrating improved efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Adaptive visual compression enables more efficient and robust vision-language models by dynamically balancing inference efficiency with representational capacity based on image complexity.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. However, handling high-dimensional visual features often incurs substantial computational and memory costs. VoCo-LLaMA alleviates this issue by compressing visual patch tokens into a few VoCo tokens, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong cross-modal alignment. Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function that integrates rate regularization with complexity alignment. This enables the model to balance inference efficiency with representational capacity, particularly in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, highlighting the potential of adaptive visual compression for creating more efficient and robust VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR enables all-weather maritime monitoring but ship type classification is challenging due to ship diversity and requires specialized deep learning models that depend on large, high-quality datasets. The growing variety of SAR satellites with different frequencies/resolutions increases the need for more annotated datasets.

Method: Created the NovaSAR Automated Ship Target Recognition (NASTaR) dataset with 3415 ship patches extracted from NovaSAR S-band imagery, labels matched to AIS data, featuring 23 unique classes, inshore/offshore separation, and auxiliary wake dataset for patches with visible ship wakes.

Conclusion: The NASTaR dataset addresses the critical need for annotated SAR ship data, enabling improved ship type classification models and supporting maritime monitoring applications. The dataset and benchmarking codes are publicly available.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers a unique capability for all-weather, space-based maritime activity monitoring by capturing and imaging strong reflections from ships at sea. A well-defined challenge in this domain is ship type classification. Due to the high diversity and complexity of ship types, accurate recognition is difficult and typically requires specialized deep learning models. These models, however, depend on large, high-quality ground-truth datasets to achieve robust performance and generalization. Furthermore, the growing variety of SAR satellites operating at different frequencies and spatial resolutions has amplified the need for more annotated datasets to enhance model accuracy. To address this, we present the NovaSAR Automated Ship Target Recognition (NASTaR) dataset. This dataset comprises of 3415 ship patches extracted from NovaSAR S-band imagery, with labels matched to AIS data. It includes distinctive features such as 23 unique classes, inshore/offshore separation, and an auxiliary wake dataset for patches where ship wakes are visible.

TL;DR: GTMA framework uses dynamic pseudo-word embeddings to improve VLM performance on out-of-distribution concepts by optimizing continuous representations that align with visual anchors, bypassing vocabulary limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with out-of-distribution concepts due to modal asymmetry - visual encoders can extract features from unseen images but text encoders are limited by fixed vocabularies, causing cross-modal alignment collapse and degraded zero-shot performance.

Method: Proposes Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework with dynamic representation optimization. At inference, constructs continuous pseudo-word embeddings that align with OOD image visual anchors. Uses adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization with semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with prior knowledge.

Result: GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by 15-20% over base VLM on ImageNet-R and VISTA-Beyond benchmarks while maintaining in-distribution performance. Ablation studies confirm necessity of pseudo-word optimization.

Conclusion: Dynamic representation optimization through GTMA effectively addresses modal asymmetry in VLMs, enabling better handling of out-of-distribution concepts by creating adaptive pseudo-word embeddings that bridge the vocabulary limitation gap.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle in open-world applications, where out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts often trigger cross-modal alignment collapse and severely degrade zero-shot performance. We identify the root cause as modal asymmetry: while the visual encoder can extract discriminative features from unseen images, the text encoder is constrained by a fixed discrete vocabulary and cannot synthesize new semantic anchors. Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.
  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.
  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of pseudo-word optimization.

*Rahul Yumlembam,Biju Issac,Nauman Aslam,Eaby Kollonoor Babu,Josh Collyer,Fraser Kennedy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust AI-generated image detection framework using multiple uncertainty measures (Fisher Information, Monte Carlo Dropout entropy, Deep Kernel Learning variance) fused via Particle Swarm Optimization to adaptively reject uncertain predictions, maintaining performance across distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated images become increasingly photorealistic, distinguishing them from natural images is challenging. Existing detection methods degrade under distribution shifts to unseen generators, requiring a more robust approach that can handle uncertainty and adapt to new data distributions.

Method: Combines three complementary uncertainty measures: 1) Fisher Information for parameter sensitivity, 2) entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout for predictive variability, and 3) predictive variance from Deep Kernel Learning with Gaussian Process classifier. Uses Particle Swarm Optimization to learn optimal weightings and determine adaptive rejection thresholds.

Result: Combined Uncertainty measure achieves ~70% incorrect rejection rate on unseen generators, filtering most misclassified AI samples. Maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks (FGSM/PGD), rejects ~61% of successful attacks (GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80%).

Conclusion: Multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection, handling distribution shifts and adversarial attacks while maintaining performance. Conservative rejection behavior is acceptable as rejected samples can support retraining.

Abstract: As AI-generated images become increasingly photorealistic, distinguishing them from natural images poses a growing challenge. This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent.

Abstract: Chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers which affect up to one-third of people with diabetes, impose a substantial clinical and economic burden, with U.S. healthcare costs exceeding 25 billion dollars annually. Current wound assessment remains predominantly subjective, leading to inconsistent classification and delayed interventions. We present WoundNet-Ensemble, an Internet of Medical Things system leveraging a novel ensemble of three complementary deep learning architectures: ResNet-50, the self-supervised Vision Transformer DINOv2, and Swin Transformer, for automated classification of six clinically distinct wound types. Our system achieves 99.90 percent ensemble accuracy on a comprehensive dataset of 5,175 wound images spanning diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, thermal burns, pilonidal sinus wounds, and fungating malignant tumors. The weighted fusion strategy demonstrates a 3.7 percent improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we implement a longitudinal wound healing tracker that computes healing rates, severity scores, and generates clinical alerts. This work demonstrates a robust, accurate, and clinically deployable tool for modernizing wound care through artificial intelligence, addressing critical needs in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring. The implementation and trained models will be made publicly available to support reproducibility.

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for multisource domain adaptation that leverages similarity between source distributions to improve pretraining, achieving 17.29% accuracy improvement on human action recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDA methods are ad-hoc with either weight sharing or independent training of source models, lacking a principled approach to leverage similarities between source domain distributions.

Method: Proposes a Hierarchical Bayesian Framework that models similarity between source data distributions to optimize pretraining for multisource domain adaptation.

Result: The framework improves accuracy on recognition tasks and achieves 17.29% improvement over state-of-the-art MDA methods on the Daily-DA RGB video benchmark for human action recognition.

Conclusion: The Bayesian framework provides a principled approach for MDA that effectively leverages similarities between source distributions, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multisource domain adaptation (MDA) aims to use multiple source datasets with available labels to infer labels on a target dataset without available labels for target supervision. Prior works on MDA in the literature is ad-hoc as the pretraining of source models is either based on weight sharing or uses independently trained models. This work proposes a Bayesian framework for pretraining in MDA by considering that the distributions of different source domains are typically similar. The Hierarchical Bayesian Framework uses similarity between the different source data distributions to optimize the pretraining for MDA. Experiments using the proposed Bayesian framework for MDA show that our framework improves accuracy on recognition tasks for a large benchmark dataset. Performance comparison with state-of-the-art MDA methods on the challenging problem of human action recognition in multi-domain benchmark Daily-DA RGB video shows the proposed Bayesian Framework offers a 17.29% improvement in accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) suffer from hallucinated outputs due to misaligned visual understanding, specifically insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment.

Method: Proposes MEDALIGN framework with two distillation losses: spatial-aware visual alignment loss based on visual token-level similarity structures, and attention-aware distillation loss that guides attention toward diagnostically relevant regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on medical report generation and medical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both performance and interpretability, yielding more visually grounded outputs.

Conclusion: MEDALIGN effectively addresses hallucination issues in Med-LVLMs through simple, lightweight alignment distillation, improving visual grounding and diagnostic relevance.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promising results in clinical applications, but often suffer from hallucinated outputs due to misaligned visual understanding. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations contributing to this issue: insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment. To address these problems, we propose MEDALIGN, a simple, lightweight alignment distillation framework that transfers visual alignment knowledge from a domain-specific Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to Med-LVLMs. MEDALIGN introduces two distillation losses: a spatial-aware visual alignment loss based on visual token-level similarity structures, and an attention-aware distillation loss that guides attention toward diagnostically relevant regions. Extensive experiments on medical report generation and medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks show that MEDALIGN consistently improves both performance and interpretability, yielding more visually grounded outputs.

TL;DR: OpenView introduces out-of-view understanding for MLLMs, creating a pipeline for generating multi-choice VQA from panoramas, a synthetic dataset for fine-tuning, and a benchmark for evaluation, boosting MLLM performance from 48.6% to 64.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at in-view reasoning but lack ability to understand objects, activities, and scenes beyond the visible frame. The paper addresses this gap by introducing out-of-view understanding as a new capability for multimodal models.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) OpenView pipeline for generating multi-choice VQA using panoramic imagery with free-view framing, 2) OpenView-Dataset curated from diverse real-world panoramas for supervised fine-tuning, 3) OpenView-Bench benchmark measuring both choice and rationale accuracy for interpretable evaluation.

Result: Experimental results show MLLMs have large gap from human performance in OOV VQA (48.6% average). When empowered by OpenView, multiple MLLMs consistently boost performance to 64.1% on average, demonstrating significant improvement.

Conclusion: OpenView enables MLLMs to reason about out-of-view content, bridging a critical gap in multimodal understanding. The framework provides tools for generating training data, fine-tuning models, and benchmarking progress in this new capability.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show great potential in natural image understanding. Yet, they perform well, mainly on reasoning in-view contents within the image frame. This paper presents the first study on out-of-view (OOV) understanding, i.e., the ability to reason objects, activities, and scenes beyond the visible frame of a perspective view. Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we design OpenView, a four-stage pipeline to massively generate multi-choice VQA by leveraging panoramic imagery to enable context-rich and spatial-grounded VQA synthesis with free-view framing. Second, we curate OpenView-Dataset, a high-quality synthetic dataset from diverse real-world panoramas to empower MLLMs upon supervised fine-tuning. Third, we build OpenView-Bench, a benchmark that jointly measures choice and rationale accuracy for interpretable and diagnosable evaluation. Experimental results show that despite having a large gap from human performance in OOV VQA answer selection, upon empowered by OpenView, multiple MLLMs can consistently boost their performance, uplifted from 48.6% to 64.1% on average.

Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a serious obstetric condition that can be challenging to diagnose with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) due to variability in radiologists' interpretations. To overcome this challenge, a hybrid 3D deep learning model for automated PAS detection from volumetric MRI scans is proposed in this study. The model integrates a 3D DenseNet121 to capture local features and a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) to model global spatial context. It was developed and evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 1,133 MRI volumes. Multiple 3D deep learning architectures were also evaluated for comparison. On an independent test set, the DenseNet121-ViT model achieved the highest performance with a five-run average accuracy of 84.3%. These results highlight the strength of hybrid CNN-Transformer models as a computer-aided diagnosis tool. The model's performance demonstrates a clear potential to assist radiologists by providing a robust decision support to improve diagnostic consistency across interpretations, and ultimately enhance the accuracy and timeliness of PAS diagnosis.

Conclusion: The vision-based trajectory analysis effectively solves low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle AEB systems, providing reliable motion state classification and significantly improving safety system performance.

Abstract: A vision-based trajectory analysis solution is proposed to address the "zero-speed braking" issue caused by inaccurate Controller Area Network (CAN) signals in commercial vehicle Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems during low-speed operation. The algorithm utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform to process sequential video frames from a blind spot camera, employing self-adaptive Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)-enhanced Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) matching. This allows for precise classification of the vehicle's motion state (static, vibration, moving). Key innovations include 1) multiframe trajectory displacement statistics (5-frame sliding window), 2) a dual-threshold state decision matrix, and 3) OBD-II driven dynamic Region of Interest (ROI) configuration. The system effectively suppresses environmental interference and false detection of dynamic objects, directly addressing the challenge of low-speed false activation in commercial vehicle safety systems. Evaluation in a real-world dataset (32,454 video segments from 1,852 vehicles) demonstrates an F1-score of 99.96% for static detection, 97.78% for moving state recognition, and a processing delay of 14.2 milliseconds (resolution 704x576). The deployment on-site shows an 89% reduction in false braking events, a 100% success rate in emergency braking, and a fault rate below 5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current restoration agents using vision-language/LLMs suffer from efficiency bottlenecks (reflection, rollback, iterative tool searching) and depend on degradation recognition models requiring extensive annotations, limiting applicability in label-free environments.

Method: Proposes a policy optimization-based restoration framework where a lightweight agent learns sequential decision-making to select appropriate restoration operations. Uses multimodal LLMs as human-aligned evaluators to provide perceptual feedback for policy improvement in label-free training.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method matches state-of-the-art performance on full-reference metrics and surpasses existing approaches on no-reference metrics across diverse degradation scenarios, despite using no supervision.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, deterministic restoration plans without redundant tool invocations, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining high restoration quality in label-free environments.

Abstract: Complex image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from inputs affected by multiple degradations such as blur, noise, rain, and compression artifacts. Recent restoration agents, powered by vision-language models and large language models, offer promising restoration capabilities but suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks due to reflection, rollback, and iterative tool searching. Moreover, their performance heavily depends on degradation recognition models that require extensive annotations for training, limiting their applicability in label-free environments. To address these limitations, we propose a policy optimization-based restoration framework that learns an lightweight agent to determine tool-calling sequences. The agent operates in a sequential decision process, selecting the most appropriate restoration operation at each step to maximize final image quality. To enable training within label-free environments, we introduce a novel reward mechanism driven by multimodal large language models, which act as human-aligned evaluator and provide perceptual feedback for policy improvement. Once trained, our agent executes a deterministic restoration plans without redundant tool invocations, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining high restoration quality. Extensive experiments show that despite using no supervision, our method matches SOTA performance on full-reference metrics and surpasses existing approaches on no-reference metrics across diverse degradation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Place Recognition needs to go beyond pixel similarity for long-term deployment, requiring transparent, interpretable decisions that remain robust under lighting, weather, and seasonal changes. Current systems lack explainability and human-readable reasoning processes.

Method: 1. Convert image sequences to textual scene descriptions, 2. Parse descriptions into structured scene graphs capturing objects, attributes, and pairwise relations, 3. Aggregate per-frame graphs into compact place representations, 4. Perform retrieval using dual-similarity mechanism: Graph Attention Network embeddings + Shortest-Path kernel for structural matching.

Result: Validated on Oxford RobotCar and MSLS (Amman/San Francisco) benchmarks, demonstrating robust retrieval under severe appearance shifts. Supports zero-shot operation using human textual queries. Shows semantic, graph-based reasoning is viable and interpretable for place recognition.

Conclusion: Graph-based semantic reasoning provides a transparent, interpretable alternative for visual place recognition, particularly suited to safety-sensitive and resource-constrained settings where explainable decision-making is crucial.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in long-term deployment requires reasoning beyond pixel similarity: systems must make transparent, interpretable decisions that remain robust under lighting, weather and seasonal change. We present Text2Graph VPR, an explainable semantic localization system that converts image sequences into textual scene descriptions, parses those descriptions into structured scene graphs, and reasons over the resulting graphs to identify places. Scene graphs capture objects, attributes and pairwise relations; we aggregate per-frame graphs into a compact place representation and perform retrieval with a dual-similarity mechanism that fuses learned Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeddings and a Shortest-Path (SP) kernel for structural matching. This hybrid design enables both learned semantic matching and topology-aware comparison, and -- critically -- produces human-readable intermediate representations that support diagnostic analysis and improve transparency in the decision process. We validate the system on Oxford RobotCar and MSLS (Amman/San Francisco) benchmarks and demonstrate robust retrieval under severe appearance shifts, along with zero-shot operation using human textual queries. The results illustrate that semantic, graph-based reasoning is a viable and interpretable alternative for place recognition, particularly suited to safety-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional animation production is labor-intensive and expensive. While recent video generation models work well for natural videos, they struggle with animation generation. Existing animation-focused approaches mainly use image-to-video models, leaving text-to-video animation generation underexplored.

Method: PTTA constructs a small but high-quality paired dataset of animation videos with textual descriptions. It then fine-tunes the pretrained text-to-video model HunyuanVideo to adapt it specifically for animation-style generation.

Result: Extensive visual evaluations across multiple dimensions show that PTTA consistently outperforms comparable baselines in animation video synthesis.

Conclusion: PTTA demonstrates that fine-tuning pretrained text-to-video models on specialized animation data can effectively bridge the gap between natural video generation and high-quality animation production.

Abstract: Traditional animation production involves complex pipelines and significant manual labor cost. While recent video generation models such as Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX achieve impressive results on natural video synthesis, they exhibit notable limitations when applied to animation generation. Recent efforts, such as AniSora, demonstrate promising performance by fine-tuning image-to-video models for animation styles, yet analogous exploration in the text-to-video setting remains limited.
  In this work, we present PTTA, a pure text-to-animation framework for high-quality animation creation. We first construct a small-scale but high-quality paired dataset of animation videos and textual descriptions. Building upon the pretrained text-to-video model HunyuanVideo, we perform fine-tuning to adapt it to animation-style generation. Extensive visual evaluations across multiple dimensions show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms comparable baselines in animation video synthesis.

Abstract: Generating or editing images directly from Neural signals has immense potential at the intersection of neuroscience, vision, and Brain-computer interaction. In this paper, We present Uni-Neur2Img, a unified framework for neural signal-driven image generation and editing. The framework introduces a parameter-efficient LoRA-based neural signal injection module that independently processes each conditioning signal as a pluggable component, facilitating flexible multi-modal conditioning without altering base model parameters. Additionally, we employ a causal attention mechanism accommodate the long-sequence modeling demands of conditional generation tasks. Existing neural-driven generation research predominantly focuses on textual modalities as conditions or intermediate representations, resulting in limited exploration of visual modalities as direct conditioning signals. To bridge this research gap, we introduce the EEG-Style dataset. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across public benchmarks and self-collected neural signal datasets: (1) EEG-driven image generation on the public CVPR40 dataset; (2) neural signal-guided image editing on the public Loongx dataset for semantic-aware local modifications; and (3) EEG-driven style transfer on our self-collected EEG-Style dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in generation fidelity, editing consistency, and style transfer quality while maintaining low computational overhead and strong scalability to additional modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution but existing event-based 3DGS approaches struggle to leverage fine-grained temporal information from sparse events, creating a trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution.

Method: Decouples rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering using ray-tracing and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering using the image of warped events.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets and competitive performance on synthetic datasets. Works without prior information or COLMAP initialization, is flexible in event selection, achieves sharp edge reconstruction with fast training.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the accuracy-temporal resolution trade-off in event-based 3DGS and deepens understanding of sparse event nature for 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a high temporal resolution over traditional frame-based cameras, which makes them suitable for motion and structure estimation. However, it has been unclear how event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches could leverage fine-grained temporal information of sparse events. This work proposes a framework to address the trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution in event-based 3DGS. Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction. The code will be released.

TL;DR: ZSL models are vulnerable to both class-level and concept-level adversarial attacks, with traditional attacks showing spurious success in GZSL that can be addressed by proposed CBEA method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Zero-shot Learning models promise better generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remains unclear, creating a need to evaluate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Method: Empirical analysis of ZSL robustness using class-level attacks (non-target class attack and proposed Class-Bias Enhanced Attack) and concept-level attacks (Class-Preserving Concept Attack and Non-Class-Preserving Concept Attack), evaluated across three typical ZSL models from recent years.

Result: ZSL models are vulnerable to both traditional class attacks and novel concept-based attacks; traditional attacks show spurious success in GZSL that disappears after calibration shift, while CBEA completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibration points.

Conclusion: Current ZSL models lack adversarial robustness, with significant vulnerability to both class and concept manipulation attacks, highlighting the need for improved defense mechanisms in ZSL systems.

Abstract: Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable image classifiers to recognize images from unseen classes that were not included during training. Unlike traditional supervised classification, ZSL typically relies on learning a mapping from visual features to predefined, human-understandable class concepts. While ZSL models promise to improve generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remain unclear. In this study, we present an empirical analysis about the robustness of existing ZSL methods at both classlevel and concept-level. Specifically, we successfully disrupted their class prediction by the well-known non-target class attack (clsA). However, in the Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) setting, we observe that the success of clsA is only at the original best-calibrated point. After the attack, the optimal bestcalibration point shifts, and ZSL models maintain relatively strong performance at other calibration points, indicating that clsA results in a spurious attack success in the GZSL. To address this, we propose the Class-Bias Enhanced Attack (CBEA), which completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibrated points by enhancing the gap between seen and unseen class probabilities.Next, at concept-level attack, we introduce two novel attack modes: Class-Preserving Concept Attack (CPconA) and NonClass-Preserving Concept Attack (NCPconA). Our extensive experiments evaluate three typical ZSL models across various architectures from the past three years and reveal that ZSL models are vulnerable not only to the traditional class attack but also to concept-based attacks. These attacks allow malicious actors to easily manipulate class predictions by erasing or introducing concepts. Our findings highlight a significant performance gap between existing approaches, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness in current ZSL models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with view inconsistency and require per-scene training for low-light 3D reconstruction from sparse views. The challenges include exposure imbalance and degraded color fidelity in low-light conditions.

Method: Uses a dual-branch predictor for stable geometric initialization of 3D Gaussians. Incorporates illumination consistency with frequency priors for controllable lighting, and an appearance refinement module to separate illumination, material, and view-dependent cues. Trains on synthetic dark views created via physics-based camera model due to lack of large-scale paired data.

Result: Achieves superior novel view synthesis, cross-view consistency, and better generalization to unseen low-light scenes compared to both 2D and 3D methods on public and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: SplatBright is the first generalizable 3D Gaussian framework that successfully addresses joint low-light enhancement and reconstruction from sparse views through physically guided illumination modeling and geometry-appearance decoupling.

Abstract: Low-light 3D reconstruction from sparse views remains challenging due to exposure imbalance and degraded color fidelity. While existing methods struggle with view inconsistency and require per-scene training, we propose SplatBright, which is, to our knowledge, the first generalizable 3D Gaussian framework for joint low-light enhancement and reconstruction from sparse sRGB inputs. Our key idea is to integrate physically guided illumination modeling with geometry-appearance decoupling for consistent low-light reconstruction. Specifically, we adopt a dual-branch predictor that provides stable geometric initialization of 3D Gaussian parameters. On the appearance side, illumination consistency leverages frequency priors to enable controllable and cross-view coherent lighting, while an appearance refinement module further separates illumination, material, and view-dependent cues to recover fine texture. To tackle the lack of large-scale geometrically consistent paired data, we synthesize dark views via a physics-based camera model for training. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that SplatBright achieves superior novel view synthesis, cross-view consistency, and better generalization to unseen low-light scenes compared with both 2D and 3D methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-matched pairs in RS image-text retrieval, achieving superior performance across multiple datasets and highlighting its practical value for real-world applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image-text retrieval faces significant challenges in real-world datasets due to the presence of Pseudo-Matched Pairs (PMPs), semantically mismatched or weakly aligned image-text pairs, which hinder the learning of reliable cross-modal alignments. To address this issue, we propose a novel retrieval framework that leverages Cross-Modal Gated Attention and a Positive-Negative Awareness Attention mechanism to mitigate the impact of such noisy associations. The gated module dynamically regulates cross-modal information flow, while the awareness mechanism explicitly distinguishes informative (positive) cues from misleading (negative) ones during alignment learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS datasets, i.e., RSICD, RSITMD, and RS5M, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world mismatches and PMPs in RS image-text retrieval tasks.

*Yiming Sun,Mi Zhang,Feifei Li,Geng Hong,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartSight is a training-free method that reduces hallucinations in Video Large Language Models by generating multiple candidate responses, assessing them with Temporal Attention Collapse scores, and using Visual Attention Vanishing points for efficient early termination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Large Language Models suffer from perceptual hallucinations that pose safety risks and limit real-world applicability. Existing mitigation methods often compromise the model's video understanding and reasoning capabilities.

Method: SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs, assesses hallucination using Temporal Attention Collapse scores (measuring whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions), and improves efficiency by identifying Visual Attention Vanishing points for early termination of hallucinated responses.

Result: SmartSight reduces hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%.

Conclusion: SmartSight effectively improves the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs by reducing hallucinations without compromising video understanding capabilities, demonstrating the value of leveraging models' own introspective capabilities in a training-free manner.

Abstract: Despite Video Large Language Models having rapidly advanced in recent years, perceptual hallucinations pose a substantial safety risk, which severely restricts their real-world applicability. While several methods for hallucination mitigation have been proposed, they often compromise the model's capacity for video understanding and reasoning. In this work, we propose SmartSight, a pioneering step to address this issue in a training-free manner by leveraging the model's own introspective capabilities. Specifically, SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs that are often obscured by standard greedy decoding. It assesses the hallucination of each response using the Temporal Attention Collapse score, which measures whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions of the input video when generating the response. To improve efficiency, SmartSight identifies the Visual Attention Vanishing point, enabling more accurate hallucination estimation and early termination of hallucinated responses, leading to a substantial reduction in decoding cost. Experiments show that SmartSight substantially lowers hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL, while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%. These results highlight SmartSight's effectiveness in improving the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs.

### [69] [AsyncDiff: Asynchronous Timestep Conditioning for Enhanced Text-to-Image Diffusion Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18675)
*Longhuan Xu,Feng Yin,Cunjian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes asynchronous diffusion inference where denoiser conditioning timestep is decoupled from latent state update schedule, using a learned timestep predictor to optimize image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard text-to-image diffusion uses synchronized schedules where latent state updates and denoiser conditioning happen at same timestep, which may not be optimal for image quality and detail control.

Method: Introduces asynchronous inference with timestep prediction module (TPM) trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to select optimal conditioning timestep based on current state. Uses scaling hyperparameter to interpolate between original and desynchronized timesteps.

Result: Method shows consistent improvement on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and Flux.1-dev across MS-COCO 2014 and T2I-CompBench datasets, optimizing composite reward averaging Image Reward, HPSv2, CLIP Score and Pick Score.

Conclusion: Decoupling denoiser conditioning from latent state updates via learned timestep prediction improves diffusion inference quality while maintaining computational efficiency (15 steps for SD3.5, 10 steps for Flux).

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion inference typically follows synchronized schedules, where the numerical integrator advances the latent state to the same timestep at which the denoiser is conditioned. We propose an asynchronous inference mechanism that decouples these two, allowing the denoiser to be conditioned at a different, learned timestep while keeping image update schedule unchanged. A lightweight timestep prediction module (TPM), trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), selects a more feasible conditioning timestep based on the current state, effectively choosing a desired noise level to control image detail and textural richness. At deployment, a scaling hyper-parameter can be used to interpolate between the original and de-synchronized timesteps, enabling conservative or aggressive adjustments. To keep the study computationally affordable, we cap the inference at 15 steps for SD3.5 and 10 steps for Flux. Evaluated on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and Flux.1-dev across MS-COCO 2014 and T2I-CompBench datasets, our method optimizes a composite reward that averages Image Reward, HPSv2, CLIP Score and Pick Score, and shows consistent improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods require custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining for multi-view geometry tasks. This research explores whether general-purpose video foundation models can be readily adapted for these tasks without extensive customization.

Method: Fine-tune general-purpose video foundation models (vision transformers) for multi-view geometry tasks. The approach involves appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone and using iterative refinement to boost performance. The core insight is that attention mechanisms in these models already learn temporal and spatial information relevant for geometric reasoning.

Conclusion: Video-pretrained vision transformers are versatile for geometric vision tasks, requiring minimal adaptation to achieve top performance. The simple approach of fine-tuning foundation models with linear decoder and iterative refinement outperforms custom-designed methods, demonstrating the power of general-purpose pretraining.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of vision transformer learning for multi-view geometry tasks, such as optical flow estimation, by fine-tuning video foundation models. Unlike previous methods that involve custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining, our research finds that general-purpose models pretrained on videos can be readily transferred to multi-view problems with minimal adaptation. The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively. Our method additionally establishes a new record on the online test benchmark with EPE values of 0.79, 1.88, and F1 value of 3.79. Applications to 3D depth estimation and stereo matching also show strong performance, illustrating the versatility of video-pretrained models in addressing geometric vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3DGS methods predict pixel-aligned primitives per-view, producing excessive primitives in dense-view settings and offering no explicit control over the number of predicted Gaussians, limiting flexibility for downstream tasks.

Method: Two-stage optimization: 1) Pixel-aligned Gaussian Training (PGT) learns initial primitive prediction; 2) Importance-aware Gaussian Finetuning (IGF) learns to rank primitives and adaptively adjust parameters based on target primitive count.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple dense-view settings show EcoSplat is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict primitive-count constraints.

Conclusion: EcoSplat enables flexible efficiency control for 3D scene reconstruction, making it well-suited for flexible downstream rendering tasks with controllable computational resources.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient one-pass scene reconstruction, providing 3D representations for novel view synthesis without per-scene optimization. However, existing methods typically predict pixel-aligned primitives per-view, producing an excessive number of primitives in dense-view settings and offering no explicit control over the number of predicted Gaussians. To address this, we propose EcoSplat, the first efficiency-controllable feed-forward 3DGS framework that adaptively predicts the 3D representation for any given target primitive count at inference time. EcoSplat adopts a two-stage optimization process. The first stage is Pixel-aligned Gaussian Training (PGT) where our model learns initial primitive prediction. The second stage is Importance-aware Gaussian Finetuning (IGF) stage where our model learns rank primitives and adaptively adjust their parameters based on the target primitive count. Extensive experiments across multiple dense-view settings show that EcoSplat is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict primitive-count constraints, making it well-suited for flexible downstream rendering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for image correction/rectangling rely on task-specific architectures, limiting generalization across different tasks. The paper aims to create a unified framework that can handle various practical photography tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective.

Method: UniRect incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different lens types. It uses a dual-component structure: 1) Deformation Module with Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) for geometric deformations, and 2) Restoration Module with Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract degradation. A Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure handles multi-task learning challenges.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared with other up-to-date methods across various image correction and rectangling tasks.

Conclusion: UniRect provides a comprehensive, unified approach to image correction and rectangling that overcomes limitations of task-specific architectures, offering better generalization and effective application across diverse practical photography tasks.

Abstract: Image correction and rectangling are valuable tasks in practical photography systems such as smartphones. Recent remarkable advancements in deep learning have undeniably brought about substantial performance improvements in these fields. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly rely on task-specific architectures. This significantly restricts their generalization ability and effective application across a wide range of different tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Unified Rectification Framework (UniRect), a comprehensive approach that addresses these practical tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective. Our approach incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different types of lenses. To handle diverse distortions, UniRect adopts one task-agnostic rectification framework with a dual-component structure: a {Deformation Module}, which utilizes a novel Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) model to address complex geometric deformations, and a subsequent Restoration Module, which employs Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract the degradation caused by the deformation process and enhance the fidelity of the output image. Moreover, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure is designed to circumvent heavy task competition in multi-task learning due to varying distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models have achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other up-to-date methods.

Abstract: Predicting breast cancer recurrence risk is a critical clinical challenge. This study investigates the potential of computational pathology to stratify patients using deep learning on routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). We developed and compared three Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks -- CLAM-SB, ABMIL, and ConvNeXt-MIL-XGBoost -- on an in-house dataset of 210 patient cases.

Conclusion: M³-Verse provides a challenging testbed to drive development of next-generation models with more holistic understanding of dynamic visual world, addressing current gaps in spatial-temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Modern Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated extraordinary ability in static image and single-state spatial-temporal understanding. However, their capacity to comprehend the dynamic changes of objects within a shared spatial context between two distinct video observations, remains largely unexplored. This ability to reason about transformations within a consistent environment is particularly crucial for advancements in the field of spatial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce $M^3-Verse$, a Multi-Modal, Multi-State, Multi-Dimensional benchmark, to formally evaluate this capability. It is built upon paired videos that provide multi-perspective observations of an indoor scene before and after a state change. The benchmark contains a total of 270 scenes and 2,932 questions, which are categorized into over 50 subtasks that probe 4 core capabilities. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art LMMs and observe their limitations in tracking state transitions. To address these challenges, we further propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves significant performance improvements in multi-state perception. $M^3-Verse$ thus provides a challenging new testbed to catalyze the development of next-generation models with a more holistic understanding of our dynamic visual world.

TL;DR: MAG framework decouples memory compression and frame generation for long video synthesis, solving catastrophic forgetting vs. memory cost trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frame-AR models for long video generation face a dilemma: window attention causes catastrophic forgetting of historical context, while full history retention is memory-prohibitive.

Method: Proposes Memorize-and-Generate (MAG) with two components: 1) memory model compresses historical information into compact KV cache, 2) generator model synthesizes frames using compressed representation.

Result: MAG achieves superior historical scene consistency while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks; introduces MAG-Bench for strict memory retention evaluation.

Conclusion: MAG effectively addresses the memory-consistency trade-off in long video generation, enabling better scene coherence without prohibitive memory costs.

Abstract: Frame-level autoregressive (frame-AR) models have achieved significant progress, enabling real-time video generation comparable to bidirectional diffusion models and serving as a foundation for interactive world models and game engines. However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose \textbf{Memorize-and-Generate (MAG)}, a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks. Specifically, we train a memory model to compress historical information into a compact KV cache, and a separate generator model to synthesize subsequent frames utilizing this compressed representation. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{MAG-Bench} to strictly evaluate historical memory retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAG achieves superior historical scene consistency while maintaining competitive performance on standard video generation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open multimodal agents lack sufficient reasoning capabilities for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams and navigating maps. There's a need for better evaluation of multimodal reasoning that requires interleaved attention to visual details.

Method: 1) Introduce O3-Bench benchmark with challenging problems requiring multi-step reasoning across distinct image areas. 2) Propose InSight-o3 multi-agent framework with vReasoner (visual reasoning agent) and vSearcher (visual search agent). 3) Define generalized visual search task for locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions. 4) Train multimodal LLM for this task via reinforcement learning.

Result: O3-Bench is highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3 (40.8% accuracy). InSight-o3's vSearcher significantly improves frontier multimodal models' performance on various benchmarks as a plug-and-play agent, marking progress toward powerful open systems.

Conclusion: The paper presents O3-Bench as a challenging benchmark for multimodal reasoning and InSight-o3 as an effective multi-agent framework that advances open multimodal systems through specialized visual search capabilities and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The ability for AI agents to "think with images" requires a sophisticated blend of reasoning and perception. However, current open multimodal agents still largely fall short on the reasoning aspect crucial for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams and navigating maps. To address this gap, we introduce O3-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning with interleaved attention to visual details. O3-Bench features challenging problems that require agents to piece together subtle visual information from distinct image areas through multi-step reasoning. The problems are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 40.8% accuracy on O3-Bench. To make progress, we propose InSight-o3, a multi-agent framework consisting of a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) and a visual search agent (vSearcher) for which we introduce the task of generalized visual search -- locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions described in free-form language, beyond just simple objects or figures in natural images. We then present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning. As a plug-and-play agent, our vSearcher empowers frontier multimodal models (as vReasoners), significantly improving their performance on a wide range of benchmarks. This marks a concrete step towards powerful o3-like open systems. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/m-Just/InSight-o3 .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPCV is a training-free compression framework for MLLMs that reduces visual token computation by pruning inside the ViT encoder while preserving textually important information through neighbor-guided reconstruction and attention stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have high computational costs due to numerous visual tokens processed by ViT encoders. Existing token pruning methods either overlook ViT overhead or risk discarding textually critical visual information without language guidance, causing feature distortions.

Method: IPCV uses Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) to temporarily reconstruct pruned tokens for attention computation with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to LLM. Also introduces Attention Stabilization (AS) to approximate K/V of pruned tokens and can enhance previous LLM-side pruning methods.

Result: IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

Conclusion: IPCV provides an effective training-free compression framework that addresses limitations of existing token pruning methods by preserving textually important visual information while reducing computational costs in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) deliver strong vision-language performance but at high computational cost, driven by numerous visual tokens processed by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder. Existing token pruning strategies are inadequate: LLM-stage token pruning overlooks the ViT's overhead, while conventional ViT token pruning, without language guidance, risks discarding textually critical visual cues and introduces feature distortions amplified by the ViT's bidirectional attention. To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition, validating the effectiveness of the proposed CAN architecture with its specialized temporal and spatial extraction modules.

Abstract: Action recognition is a critical task in video understanding, requiring the comprehensive capture of spatio-temporal cues across various scales. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.

*Guohui Zhang,Hu Yu,Xiaoxiao Ma,Yaning Pan,Hang Xu,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskFocus is a novel RL framework for masked generative models that optimizes policy by focusing on critical sampling steps based on information gain, reducing computational cost while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has shown promise for post-training language models and autoregressive visual models, but adapting it to masked generative models is challenging due to the need to account for probability likelihoods across entire sampling trajectories, which is computationally expensive.

Method: MaskFocus identifies critical sampling steps by measuring similarity between intermediate images and final generated images to determine step-level information gain. It performs focused policy optimization on these valuable steps and uses a dynamic routing sampling mechanism based on entropy to explore better masking strategies for low-entropy samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple Text-to-Image benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the MaskFocus method.

Conclusion: MaskFocus successfully addresses the RL adaptation challenge for masked generative models by focusing optimization on critical steps, reducing computational cost while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential for post-training language models and autoregressive visual generative models, but adapting RL to masked generative models remains challenging. The core factor is that policy optimization requires accounting for the probability likelihood of each step due to its multi-step and iterative refinement process. This reliance on entire sampling trajectories introduces high computational cost, whereas natively optimizing random steps often yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we present MaskFocus, a novel RL framework that achieves effective policy optimization for masked generative models by focusing on critical steps. Specifically, we determine the step-level information gain by measuring the similarity between the intermediate images at each sampling step and the final generated image. Crucially, we leverage this to identify the most critical and valuable steps and execute focused policy optimization on them. Furthermore, we design a dynamic routing sampling mechanism based on entropy to encourage the model to explore more valuable masking strategies for samples with low entropy. Extensive experiments on multiple Text-to-Image benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wenze Liu,Weicai Ye,Minghong Cai,Quande Liu,Xintao Wang,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICAC introduces a framework for audio-controlled video generation using diffusion transformers, proposing Masked 3D Attention to overcome training challenges while achieving strong lip sync and video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models focus on text, images, and depth maps but neglect time-synchronous audio signals for speech-driven video generation, creating a gap in unified multimodal video synthesis.

Method: Three audio injection mechanisms are explored: standard cross-attention, 2D self-attention, and unified 3D self-attention. The proposed Masked 3D Attention constrains attention patterns to enforce temporal alignment for stable training.

Result: The approach achieves strong lip synchronization and high video quality when conditioned on audio streams and reference images, demonstrating effective audio-visual correlation learning.

Conclusion: ICAC successfully integrates audio control into video diffusion transformers, with Masked 3D Attention providing a practical solution to training challenges while capturing spatio-temporal audio-visual correlations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have seen a shift towards unified, transformer-based foundation models that can handle multiple conditional inputs in-context. However, these models have primarily focused on modalities like text, images, and depth maps, while strictly time-synchronous signals like audio have been underexplored. This paper introduces In-Context Audio Control of video diffusion transformers (ICAC), a framework that investigates the integration of audio signals for speech-driven video generation within a unified full-attention architecture, akin to FullDiT. We systematically explore three distinct mechanisms for injecting audio conditions: standard cross-attention, 2D self-attention, and unified 3D self-attention. Our findings reveal that while 3D attention offers the highest potential for capturing spatio-temporal audio-visual correlations, it presents significant training challenges. To overcome this, we propose a Masked 3D Attention mechanism that constrains the attention pattern to enforce temporal alignment, enabling stable training and superior performance. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong lip synchronization and video quality, conditioned on an audio stream and reference images.

*Fanis Mathioulakis,Gorjan Radevski,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eff-GRot is an efficient, generalizable rotation estimation method that predicts object rotation from RGB images in a single forward pass without object-specific training, using a transformer to compare query and reference images in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rotation estimation methods often require object- or category-specific training, lack efficiency for latency-sensitive applications, and may not generalize well across different objects or categories.

Method: Uses a transformer architecture that jointly processes rotation-aware representations from multiple reference images (with known orientations) alongside a query image, performing comparisons in latent space to predict rotation in a single forward pass.

Result: Achieves favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, remaining simple, scalable, and fully end-to-end, showing promise for latency-sensitive applications.

Conclusion: Eff-GRot offers a promising direction toward more efficient rotation estimation that doesn't require object-specific training, with good generalization capabilities suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: We introduce Eff-GRot, an approach for efficient and generalizable rotation estimation from RGB images. Given a query image and a set of reference images with known orientations, our method directly predicts the object's rotation in a single forward pass, without requiring object- or category-specific training. At the core of our framework is a transformer that performs a comparison in the latent space, jointly processing rotation-aware representations from multiple references alongside a query. This design enables a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency while remaining simple, scalable, and fully end-to-end. Experimental results show that Eff-GRot offers a promising direction toward more efficient rotation estimation, particularly in latency-sensitive applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempoMoE: A hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module for music-to-3D dance generation that uses tempo instead of genre labels to achieve better rhythm alignment and dance quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on noisy, coarse, or unavailable genre labels which can cause rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. Tempo is more consistent across datasets and genres (60-200 BPM range) and better reflects musical rhythm and pace.

Method: Proposes TempoMoE - a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges. Uses multi-scale beat experts to capture fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. Features Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing that dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features without manual genre labels.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both dance quality and rhythm alignment compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TempoMoE enables flexible, rhythm-aligned dance generation without relying on problematic genre labels by leveraging tempo as a more consistent and reliable musical property for rhythm perception and synchronization.

Abstract: Music to 3D dance generation aims to synthesize realistic and rhythmically synchronized human dance from music. While existing methods often rely on additional genre labels to further improve dance generation, such labels are typically noisy, coarse, unavailable, or insufficient to capture the diversity of real-world music, which can result in rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. In contrast, we observe that tempo, a core property reflecting musical rhythm and pace, remains relatively consistent across datasets and genres, typically ranging from 60 to 200 BPM. Based on this finding, we propose TempoMoE, a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that enhances the diffusion model and its rhythm perception. TempoMoE organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges, with multi-scale beat experts capturing fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. A Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features, enabling flexible, rhythm-aligned generation without manual genre labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in dance quality and rhythm alignment.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables efficient, privacy-preserving video violence detection on-device with significant parameter and communication reductions while maintaining reasonable accuracy under strong privacy constraints.

Abstract: The rapid growth of short-form video platforms increases the need for privacy-preserving moderation, as cloud-based pipelines expose raw videos to privacy risks, high bandwidth costs, and inference latency. To address these challenges, we propose an on-device federated learning framework for video violence detection that integrates self-supervised VideoMAE representations, LoRA-based parameter-efficient adaptation, and defense-in-depth privacy protection. Our approach reduces the trainable parameter count to 5.5M (~3.5% of a 156M backbone) and incorporates DP-SGD with configurable privacy budgets and secure aggregation. Experiments on RWF-2000 with 40 clients achieve 77.25% accuracy without privacy protection and 65-66% under strong differential privacy, while reducing communication cost by $28.3\times$ compared to full-model federated learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), identifies two key internal patterns (GATE for perception and SAD for generation), and proposes VDC strategy to mitigate hallucinations by replacing unsupported tokens with validated dominant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) despite their remarkable capabilities, requiring systematic analysis of internal mechanisms to understand and address this issue.

Method: The paper conducts systematic analysis of LVLMs' internal evolution, revealing GATE process (Global scan → Approach/Tighten → Explore) for visual perception and SAD pattern (Subdominant Accumulation to Dominant) for token generation. Based on these findings, they devise VDC (Validated Dominance Correction) strategy that detects unsupported hallucinated tokens and replaces them with validated dominant ones.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that VDC substantially mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs.

Conclusion: The systematic analysis reveals fundamental patterns in LVLM hallucinations, and the proposed VDC strategy effectively improves output reliability by correcting unsupported tokens based on validated dominant alternatives.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet hallucinations remain a persistent challenge. This work presents a systematic analysis of the internal evolution of visual perception and token generation in LVLMs, revealing two key patterns. First, perception follows a three-stage GATE process: early layers perform a Global scan, intermediate layers Approach and Tighten on core content, and later layers Explore supplementary regions. Second, generation exhibits an SAD (Subdominant Accumulation to Dominant) pattern, where hallucinated tokens arise from the repeated accumulation of subdominant tokens lacking support from attention (visual perception) or feed-forward network (internal knowledge). Guided by these findings, we devise the VDC (Validated Dominance Correction) strategy, which detects unsupported tokens and replaces them with validated dominant ones to improve output reliability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that VDC substantially mitigates hallucinations.

*Yuxiao Yang,Hualian Sheng,Sijia Cai,Jing Lin,Jiahao Wang,Bing Deng,Junzhe Lu,Haoqian Wang,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoMotion is a framework that improves human action video generation by jointly modeling appearance and human motion using a dual-branch DiT architecture with synchronized 3D positional encoding and two-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with complex human movements due to pixel-only training objectives that prioritize appearance fidelity over learning kinematic principles, limiting their ability to generate plausible human actions.

Method: EchoMotion extends DiT with dual-branch architecture for joint appearance-motion processing, introduces MVS-RoPE for unified 3D positional encoding across modalities, and uses a two-stage training strategy. Also created HuMoVe dataset with 80K video-motion pairs.

Result: Explicitly representing human motion complements appearance modeling, significantly improving coherence and plausibility of human-centric video generation, enabling both joint generation and cross-modal conditional tasks.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of appearance and human motion addresses limitations of pixel-only approaches, with synchronized positional encoding and two-stage training enabling high-quality complex human action video generation.

Abstract: Video generation models have advanced significantly, yet they still struggle to synthesize complex human movements due to the high degrees of freedom in human articulation. This limitation stems from the intrinsic constraints of pixel-only training objectives, which inherently bias models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of learning underlying kinematic principles. To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation. EchoMotion extends the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) framework with a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes tokens concatenated from different modalities. Furthermore, we propose MVS-RoPE (Motion-Video Syncronized RoPE), which offers unified 3D positional encoding for both video and motion tokens. By providing a synchronized coordinate system for the dual-modal latent sequence, MVS-RoPE establishes an inductive bias that fosters temporal alignment between the two modalities. We also propose a Motion-Video Two-Stage Training Strategy. This strategy enables the model to perform both the joint generation of complex human action videos and their corresponding motion sequences, as well as versatile cross-modal conditional generation tasks. To facilitate the training of a model with these capabilities, we construct HuMoVe, a large-scale dataset of approximately 80,000 high-quality, human-centric video-motion pairs. Our findings reveal that explicitly representing human motion is complementary to appearance, significantly boosting the coherence and plausibility of human-centric video generation.

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework that extracts spatial-temporal EEG features and integrates them into Latent Diffusion Models to reconstruct visual stimuli from brain activity, achieving improved semantic interpretation of EEG signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in brain activity decoding, neural representations remain poorly interpretable due to EEG signal challenges like high noise, spatial diffusion, and temporal variability. The paper aims to better interpret the neural mechanisms underlying thoughts by reconstructing visual stimuli from EEG recordings.

Method: Proposes a transformers-based framework to extract spatial-temporal representations from EEG signals associated with visual stimuli. These features are then incorporated into the attention mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to reconstruct visual stimuli from brain activity.

Result: Quantitative evaluations on public benchmark datasets show the method excels at modeling semantic structures from EEG signals, achieving 6.5% increase in latent space clustering accuracy and 11.8% increase in zero-shot generalization across unseen classes, while maintaining comparable Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance with existing baselines.

Conclusion: The work represents a significant step toward generalizable semantic interpretation of EEG signals, demonstrating improved capability to extract meaningful representations from noisy brain activity data for visual stimulus reconstruction.

Abstract: Advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have enabled preliminary decoding of brain activity. However, despite the progress, the interpretability of neural representations remains limited. A significant challenge arises from the intrinsic properties of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, including high noise levels, spatial diffusion, and pronounced temporal variability. To interpret the neural mechanism underlying thoughts, we propose a transformers-based framework to extract spatial-temporal representations associated with observed visual stimuli from EEG recordings. These features are subsequently incorporated into the attention mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to facilitate the reconstruction of visual stimuli from brain activity. The quantitative evaluations on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method excels at modeling the semantic structures from EEG signals; achieving up to 6.5% increase in latent space clustering accuracy and 11.8% increase in zero shot generalization across unseen classes while having comparable Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance with existing baselines. Our work marks a significant step towards generalizable semantic interpretation of the EEG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data visualization integrity is threatened by image editing techniques that enable deceptive tampering, creating a need for detection and analysis tools.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) semi-fragile watermark module for precise tampering localization while preserving visual quality, 2) MLLM-based intent analysis module to interpret manipulation and infer attacker intent.

Result: Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: VizDefender provides a comprehensive solution for protecting data visualization integrity through tampering detection and intent analysis.

Abstract: The integrity of data visualizations is increasingly threatened by image editing techniques that enable subtle yet deceptive tampering. Through a formative study, we define this challenge and categorize tampering techniques into two primary types: data manipulation and visual encoding manipulation. To address this, we present VizDefender, a framework for tampering detection and analysis. The framework integrates two core components: 1) a semi-fragile watermark module that protects the visualization by embedding a location map to images, which allows for the precise localization of tampered regions while preserving visual quality, and 2) an intent analysis module that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret manipulation, inferring the attacker's intent and misleading effects. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

*Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeX is a training-free interpretability framework that uses cross-modal decomposition and image-specific concepts to generate natural language counterfactual explanations for classifier decisions, particularly in subjective domains like image privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-driven counterfactual explanations need better methods to handle subjective, contextual decisions like image privacy, where explanations should be grounded in specific image elements and expressed naturally.

Method: DeX leverages cross-modal decompositionality and image-specific concepts to create counterfactual scenarios in natural language. It uses multi-criterion selection considering image similarity (minimal perturbations) and decision confidence (impactful changes) to identify key decision factors.

Result: DeX generates image-grounded, sparse explanations with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. It uncovers principal contributing factors for subjective decisions and identifies underlying dataset biases for targeted fairness mitigation.

Conclusion: DeX provides a flexible, training-free framework for generating natural language counterfactual explanations that effectively explain subjective classifier decisions while revealing dataset biases for fairness improvements.

Abstract: Concept-driven counterfactuals explain decisions of classifiers by altering the model predictions through semantic changes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages cross-modal decompositionality and image-specific concepts to create counterfactual scenarios expressed in natural language. We apply the proposed interpretability framework, termed Decompose and Explain (DeX), to the challenging domain of image privacy decisions, which are contextual and subjective. This application enables the quantification of the differential contributions of key scene elements to the model prediction. We identify relevant decision factors via a multi-criterion selection mechanism that considers both image similarity for minimal perturbations and decision confidence to prioritize impactful changes. This approach evaluates and compares diverse explanations, and assesses the interdependency and mutual influence among explanatory properties. By leveraging image-specific concepts, DeX generates image-grounded, sparse explanations, yielding significant improvements over the state of the art. Importantly, DeX operates as a training-free framework, offering high flexibility. Results show that DeX not only uncovers the principal contributing factors influencing subjective decisions, but also identifies underlying dataset biases allowing for targeted mitigation strategies to improve fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models can't handle the complex multitask requirements of crash video analysis (recognition, temporal grounding, video understanding) in a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models are underexplored.

Method: Built on VideoLLaMA3, uses instruction fine-tuning for domain knowledge and a novel multitask learning strategy with task decoupling and grouping to maximize joint learning benefits while mitigating negative transfer.

Result: Outperforms existing MLLMs and traditional vision methods: near-perfect crash recognition accuracy, 176% improvement in crash localization, 40% improvement in pre-crash localization, and substantial improvements in textual accuracy (0.18-0.41 BLEU, 0.18-0.42 ROUGE).

Conclusion: CrashChat is an effective end-to-end tool for practical crash video analysis that addresses the multitask challenges through specialized architecture and training strategies.

Abstract: Automating crash video analysis is essential to leverage the growing availability of driving video data for traffic safety research and accountability attribution in autonomous driving. Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores. Beyond its strong performance, CrashChat is a convenient, end-to-end analytical tool ready for practical implementation.

*Akshit Achara,Peter Triantafillou,Esther Puyol-Antón,Alexander Hammers,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSCAR is a model-agnostic framework that quantifies shortcut learning and localizes shortcut features using attribution map rank profiles and correlation analysis across three models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding shortcut learning are mostly qualitative and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains like medical imaging where shortcuts may not be visually apparent.

Method: OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles and compares them across three models: balanced baseline (BA), test model (TS), and sensitive attribute predictor (SA). It computes pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles to quantify shortcut reliance and rank image regions contributing to it.

Result: Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show OSCAR correlations are stable across seeds/partitions, sensitive to shortcut-label associations, and can distinguish localized vs diffuse shortcut features. The method can reduce worst-group performance disparities using test-time attenuation based on identified shortcut regions.

Conclusion: OSCAR provides a lightweight, pixel-space audit that yields statistical decision rules and spatial maps, enabling users to test, localize, and mitigate shortcut reliance in models, particularly useful for domains where shortcuts are not human-visible.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often exploit shortcuts. These are spurious cues which are associated with output labels in the training data but are unrelated to task semantics. When the shortcut features are associated with sensitive attributes, shortcut learning can lead to biased model performance. Existing methods for localising and understanding shortcut learning are mostly based upon qualitative, image-level inspection and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains such as medical imaging. We introduce OSCAR (Ordinal Scoring Correlations for Attribution Representations), a model-agnostic framework for quantifying shortcut learning and localising shortcut features. OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles of image regions and compares them across three models: a balanced baseline model (BA), a test model (TS), and a sensitive attribute predictor (SA). By computing pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles, we produce a set of quantitative metrics that characterise the degree of shortcut reliance for TS, together with a ranking of image-level regions that contribute most to it. Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show that our correlations are (i) stable across seeds and partitions, (ii) sensitive to the level of association between shortcut features and output labels in the training data, and (iii) able to distinguish localised from diffuse shortcut features. As an illustration of the utility of our method, we show how worst-group performance disparities can be reduced using a simple test-time attenuation approach based on the identified shortcut regions. OSCAR provides a lightweight, pixel-space audit that yields statistical decision rules and spatial maps, enabling users to test, localise, and mitigate shortcut reliance.

*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Zongyan Han,Omkar Thawakar,Rao Anwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FiNDR is a reasoning-augmented LMM framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained image recognition that uses LMM reasoning to generate candidate labels, filters them with a vision-language model, and builds a lightweight classifier, achieving state-of-the-art performance without human-defined vocabularies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition methods are limited by either rigid vocabulary lists or complex pipelines with error propagation. Recent LMMs have strong reasoning capabilities for visual-language understanding, suggesting a more principled alternative.

Method: FiNDR operates in three automated steps: 1) Reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; 2) Vision-language model filters and ranks candidates to form coherent class set; 3) Verified names instantiate lightweight multi-modal classifier for inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks with up to 18.8% relative improvement over previous approaches. Surpasses zero-shot baselines using pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound.

Conclusion: Reasoning-augmented LMMs provide an effective foundation for scalable, fully automated, open-world fine-grained visual recognition. Carefully curated prompts enable open-source LMMs to match proprietary counterparts.

Abstract: Vocabulary-free fine-grained image recognition aims to distinguish visually similar categories within a meta-class without a fixed, human-defined label set. Existing solutions for this problem are limited by either the usage of a large and rigid list of vocabularies or by the dependency on complex pipelines with fragile heuristics where errors propagate across stages. Meanwhile, the ability of recent large multi-modal models (LMMs) equipped with explicit or implicit reasoning to comprehend visual-language data, decompose problems, retrieve latent knowledge, and self-correct suggests a more principled and effective alternative. Building on these capabilities, we propose FiNDR (Fine-grained Name Discovery via Reasoning), the first reasoning-augmented LMM-based framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition. The system operates in three automated steps: (i) a reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; (ii) a vision-language model filters and ranks these candidates to form a coherent class set; and (iii) the verified names instantiate a lightweight multi-modal classifier used at inference time. Extensive experiments on popular fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under the vocabulary-free setting, with a significant relative margin of up to 18.8% over previous approaches. Remarkably, the proposed method surpasses zero-shot baselines that exploit pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound. Additionally, we show that carefully curated prompts enable open-source LMMs to match proprietary counterparts. These findings establish reasoning-augmented LMMs as an effective foundation for scalable, fully automated, open-world fine-grained visual recognition.

Motivation: Standard visual projectors in MLLMs use simple MLPs that scale poorly with high-resolution inputs, creating significant redundancy and computational bottlenecks when processing dense visual tokens.

Method: Proposes Delta-LLaVA with a base-then-specialize design: 1) low-rank DeltaProjection aligns multi-level vision features into compact subspace, 2) lightweight Transformer blocks act as specialization layers to capture global/local structure under constrained token budgets.

Result: Achieves consistent gains across multiple benchmarks with only 144 tokens; improves inference throughput by up to 55%; accelerates end-to-end training by 4-5x in pretraining and over 1.5x in finetuning.

Conclusion: The base-then-specialize design with token-efficient projection highlights the importance of proper token formation before scaling interaction capacity, offering dual benefits in efficiency and scalability for MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual representations to enable rich reasoning capabilities. However, the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens remains a major bottleneck. A critical component in this pipeline is the visual projector, which bridges the vision encoder and the language model. Standard designs often employ a simple multi-layer perceptron for direct token mapping, but this approach scales poorly with high-resolution inputs, introducing significant redundancy. We present Delta-LLaVA, a token-efficient projector that employs a low-rank DeltaProjection to align multi-level vision features into a compact subspace before further interaction. On top of this base alignment, lightweight Transformer blocks act as specialization layers, capturing both global and local structure under constrained token budgets. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that this base-then-specialize design yields consistent gains across multiple benchmarks with only 144 tokens, highlighting the importance of token formation prior to scaling interaction capacity. With Delta-LLaVA, inference throughput improves by up to 55%, while end-to-end training accelerates by nearly 4-5x in pretraining and over 1.5x in finetuning, highlighting the dual benefits of our design in both efficiency and scalability.

TL;DR: LouvreSAE: A training-light, interpretable method for artistic style transfer using art-specific Sparse Autoencoder on latent embeddings, creating decomposable style profiles for direct steering without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style transfer methods are computationally expensive (require fine-tuning, adapters, or prompt engineering) and often entangle style with subject matter. There's a need for a lightweight, interpretable approach that separates style from content.

Method: Train an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on latent embeddings of generative image models using artistic data. The SAE learns disentangled stylistic and compositional concepts (brushwork, texture, color palette, semantic/structure). Use these to create style profiles - compact, decomposable steering vectors for direct style transfer without model updates.

Result: Achieves or surpasses existing methods on ArtBench10 style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster. The method is interpretable and requires no fine-tuning, LoRA training, or additional inference passes.

Conclusion: LouvreSAE provides an efficient, interpretable solution for artistic style transfer that disentangles style from content, enabling direct steering from few reference images without computational overhead of traditional methods.

Abstract: Artistic style transfer in generative models remains a significant challenge, as existing methods often introduce style only via model fine-tuning, additional adapters, or prompt engineering, all of which can be computationally expensive and may still entangle style with subject matter. In this paper, we introduce a training- and inference-light, interpretable method for representing and transferring artistic style. Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images. We validate our method on ArtBench10, achieving or surpassing existing methods on style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster and, critically, interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models have limited object referring ability when relying solely on text prompts, especially in cluttered or out-of-distribution scenes where referential ambiguity is high.

Method: Developed Point-VLA that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) for precise object-level grounding. Created an automatic data annotation pipeline to efficiently scale visually grounded datasets with minimal human effort.

Result: Point-VLA consistently outperforms text-only instruction VLAs on diverse real-world referring tasks, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, showing robust generalization.

Conclusion: Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control in vision-language-action systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models align vision and language with embodied control, but their object referring ability remains limited when relying solely on text prompt, especially in cluttered or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes. In this study, we introduce the Point-VLA, a plug-and-play policy that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) to resolve referential ambiguity and enable precise object-level grounding. To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization. These results demonstrate that Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control.

*Nicolas Caytuiro,Ivan Sipiran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric approach to improve 3D shape symmetry by training generative models on half-objects instead of modifying model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generative models often produce asymmetrical shapes. Instead of complex architectural changes, the paper proposes modifying training data to enforce symmetry.

Method: Analyze reflectional symmetry in real 3D shapes and generated samples. Create half-object datasets by reflecting shapes along x=0 plane. Train generative models exclusively on these half-objects, then reflect during generation to produce complete symmetric shapes.

Result: Generated shapes show improved symmetry and consistency compared to original models and dataset objects across three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, Chair).

Conclusion: Data-centric approach using half-object training effectively promotes symmetry in 3D generative models without architectural modifications, producing visually plausible and geometrically symmetric shapes.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-centric approach to promote symmetry in 3D generative models by modifying the training data rather than the model architecture. Our method begins with an analysis of reflectional symmetry in both real-world 3D shapes and samples generated by state-of-the-art models. We hypothesize that training a generative model exclusively on half-objects, obtained by reflecting one half of the shapes along the x=0 plane, enables the model to learn a rich distribution of partial geometries which, when reflected during generation, yield complete shapes that are both visually plausible and geometrically symmetric. To test this, we construct a new dataset of half-objects from three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, and Chair) and train two generative models. Experiments demonstrate that the generated shapes are symmetrical and consistent, compared with the generated objects from the original model and the original dataset objects.

*Zaidao Han,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOIC introduces a dual-decoder framework for 3D semantic scene completion that separates visible-region perception from occluded-region reasoning using explicit visible region label extraction to address feature dilution in monocular SSC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular SSC methods suffer from interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning, causing feature dilution and error propagation due to single-image input limitations.

Method: Proposes VRLE (Visible Region Label Extraction) to separate voxel-level supervision, and VOIC (Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network) - a dual-decoder framework with visible decoder for geometric/semantic priors and occlusion decoder for global scene reasoning with cross-modal interaction.

Result: VOIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks, outperforming existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicitly decoupling visible-region perception from occluded-region reasoning with purified supervision addresses feature dilution in monocular SSC, leading to improved 3D semantic scene completion performance.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task for autonomous driving and robotic scene understanding. It aims to infer a complete 3D volumetric representation of both semantics and geometry from a single image. Existing methods typically focus on end-to-end 2D-to-3D feature lifting and voxel completion. However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Guandong Li,Yijun Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVI is a zero-shot framework that disentangles identity into semantic and visual streams to address Semantic-Visual Dissonance in identity customization, using VAE latent statistics and parameter-free feature modulation to preserve both facial fidelity and visual atmosphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tuning-free identity customization methods achieve high facial fidelity but overlook visual context (lighting, skin texture, environmental tone), leading to Semantic-Visual Dissonance where accurate facial geometry clashes with input atmosphere, creating unnatural "sticker-like" effects.

Method: DVI orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. It exploits VAE latent space statistical properties (mean and variance) as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. Uses Parameter-Free Feature Modulation to adaptively modulate semantic embeddings with visual statistics, and Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler to prioritize visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later.

Result: Extensive experiments show DVI significantly enhances visual consistency and atmospheric fidelity without parameter fine-tuning, maintains robust identity preservation, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in IBench evaluations.

Conclusion: DVI effectively addresses Semantic-Visual Dissonance by disentangling identity components and using parameter-free modulation, achieving superior visual consistency while preserving identity fidelity in zero-shot identity customization.

Abstract: Recent tuning-free identity customization methods achieve high facial fidelity but often overlook visual context, such as lighting, skin texture, and environmental tone. This limitation leads to ``Semantic-Visual Dissonance,'' where accurate facial geometry clashes with the input's unique atmosphere, causing an unnatural ``sticker-like'' effect. We propose **DVI (Disentangled Visual-Identity)**, a zero-shot framework that orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. Unlike methods relying solely on semantic vectors, DVI exploits the inherent statistical properties of the VAE latent space, utilizing mean and variance as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. We introduce a **Parameter-Free Feature Modulation** mechanism that adaptively modulates semantic embeddings with these visual statistics, effectively injecting the reference's ``visual soul'' without training. Furthermore, a **Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler** aligns with the diffusion process, prioritizing visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVI significantly enhances visual consistency and atmospheric fidelity without parameter fine-tuning, maintaining robust identity preservation and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in IBench evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for curvature regularization methods that can produce solutions with sharp edges and precise isotropic properties while avoiding complex parameter tuning and being robust to parameter choices.

Method: Formulate total normal curvature regularization from multiple directions, reformulate as steady-state solution of time-dependent PDE system, use operator splitting for time discretization with closed-form or efficient solutions for subproblems.

Result: Method circumvents complex parameter tuning, demonstrates robustness to parameter choices, and is validated as efficient and effective for surface and image smoothing problems.

Conclusion: The proposed total normal curvature regularization with PDE-based optimization via operator splitting provides an effective approach for curvature regularization with sharp edge preservation and isotropic properties.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for curvature regularization by penalizing normal curvatures from multiple directions. This total normal curvature regularization is capable of producing solutions with sharp edges and precise isotropic properties. To tackle the resulting high-order nonlinear optimization problem, we reformulate it as the task of finding the steady-state solution of a time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) system. Time discretization is achieved through operator splitting, where each subproblem at the fractional steps either has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved using advanced algorithms. Our method circumvents the need for complex parameter tuning and demonstrates robustness to parameter choices. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach have been rigorously validated in the context of surface and image smoothing problems.

*Cheng-Hong Chang,Pei-Hsuan Tsai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SASOW improves compositional zero-shot learning by enhancing state and object recognition with self-attention mechanisms and incorporating weighting during composition, outperforming previous methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object recognition systems typically identify objects alone without considering their states. While compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) addresses this by treating states and objects separately, existing methods like KG-SP have limitations in recognition accuracy and don't consider weighting of states and objects during composition.

Method: SASOW enhances KG-SP by: 1) Introducing self-attention mechanisms into state and object classifiers to improve recognition accuracy, and 2) Incorporating weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions.

Result: SASOW shows improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in accuracy for unseen compositions compared to OW-CZSL approach and KG-SP on MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets respectively.

Conclusion: SASOW successfully improves compositional zero-shot learning by enhancing both state/object recognition accuracy and composition generation through weighting considerations, demonstrating superior performance on established benchmarks.

Abstract: Object recognition has become prevalent across various industries. However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods require training large neural networks or designing complex association modules, which are computationally expensive and overlook the geometric priors inherent in raw point clouds.

Method: Uses Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to associate temporally consistent instances by aligning point sets with estimated transformations. Incorporates Sinkhorn-based soft matching for robust association under noisy predictions. Features a pipeline handling three instance types: static, dynamic, and missing instances.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both SemanticKITTI and panoptic nuScenes datasets without requiring additional training or extra point cloud inputs.

Conclusion: ICP-4D demonstrates that geometric reasoning through ICP alignment provides an effective, training-free solution for 4D LiDAR panoptic segmentation, offering computational efficiency and robust performance.

Abstract: Dominant paradigms for 4D LiDAR panoptic segmentation are usually required to train deep neural networks with large superimposed point clouds or design dedicated modules for instance association. However, these approaches perform redundant point processing and consequently become computationally expensive, yet still overlook the rich geometric priors inherently provided by raw point clouds. To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation. To stabilize association under noisy instance predictions, we introduce a Sinkhorn-based soft matching. This exploits the underlying instance distribution to obtain accurate point-wise correspondences, resulting in robust geometric alignment. Furthermore, our carefully designed pipeline, which considers three instance types-static, dynamic, and missing-offers computational efficiency and occlusion-aware matching. Our extensive experiments across both SemanticKITTI and panoptic nuScenes demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, even without additional training or extra point cloud inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-guided ecological classification is crucial for global sustainability efforts like biodiversity monitoring and conservation, but current methods are hindered by long-tailed taxonomic distributions, fine-grained variations, test-time domain shifts, and closed-set assumptions that can't recognize unseen taxa.

Method: Proposes TaxoNet: an embedding-based encoder with dual-margin penalization loss that strengthens learning from rare underrepresented taxa while mitigating dominance of overrepresented ones, addressing multiple interrelated challenges simultaneously in a unified open-world framework.

Result: TaxoNet consistently outperforms baselines across diverse ecological domains (Google Auto-Arborist, iNat-Plantae, NAFlora-Mini), particularly excelling at classifying rare taxa, establishing a strong foundation for open-world plant taxonomic monitoring.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in ecological taxonomy classification, showing that general-purpose multimodal foundation models remain limited in plant-domain applications, while TaxoNet provides an effective solution for realistic open-world ecological settings.

Abstract: AI-guided classification of ecological families, genera, and species underpins global sustainability efforts such as biodiversity monitoring, conservation planning, and policy-making. Progress toward this goal is hindered by long-tailed taxonomic distributions from class imbalance, along with fine-grained taxonomic variations, test-time spatiotemporal domain shifts, and closed-set assumptions that can only recognize previously seen taxa. We introduce the Open-World Ecological Taxonomy Classification, a unified framework that captures the co-occurrence of these challenges in realistic ecological settings. To address them, we propose TaxoNet, an embedding-based encoder with a dual-margin penalization loss that strengthens learning signals from rare underrepresented taxa while mitigating the dominance of overrepresented ones, directly confronting interrelated challenges. We evaluate our method on diverse ecological domains: Google Auto-Arborist (urban trees), iNat-Plantae (Plantae observations from various ecosystems in iNaturalist-2019), and NAFlora-Mini (a curated herbarium collection). Our model consistently outperforms baselines, particularly for rare taxa, establishing a strong foundation for open-world plant taxonomic monitoring. Our findings further show that general-purpose multimodal foundation models remain constrained in plant-domain applications.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), existing benchmarks remain confined to fixed, small-scale datasets with naive physical simulation. These shortcomings limit the insight that the benchmarks provide into sim-to-real generalization, and create a significant research gap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVLP-IL is a vision-language pre-trained model framework for rehearsal-free incremental learning in face presentation attack detection, using multi-aspect prompting and selective elastic weight consolidation to balance stability and plasticity while maintaining privacy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face PAD needs incremental learning to handle evolving spoofing tactics and domains, but privacy regulations prohibit retaining past data, requiring rehearsal-free IL solutions. VLP models offer efficient adaptation capabilities through prompt-tuning.

Method: SVLP-IL uses Multi-Aspect Prompting (MAP) to isolate domain dependencies and enhance distribution-shift sensitivity, plus Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation (SEWC) to preserve critical weights from previous tasks while allowing new adaptations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAD benchmarks show SVLP-IL significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance on unseen domains.

Conclusion: SVLP-IL provides a privacy-compliant, practical solution for robust lifelong PAD deployment in rehearsal-free incremental learning settings.

Abstract: Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) demands incremental learning (IL) to combat evolving spoofing tactics and domains. Privacy regulations, however, forbid retaining past data, necessitating rehearsal-free IL (RF-IL). Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, with their prompt-tunable cross-modal representations, enable efficient adaptation to new spoofing styles and domains. Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues. SEWC selectively preserves critical weights from previous tasks, retaining essential knowledge while allowing flexibility for new adaptations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAD benchmarks show that SVLP-IL significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance on unseen domains. SVLP-IL offers a privacy-compliant, practical solution for robust lifelong PAD deployment in RF-IL settings.

*Connor Kilrain,David Carlyn,Julia Chae,Sara Beery,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Finer-Personalization Rank is a new evaluation protocol for personalized generative models that uses retrieval-based ranking instead of pairwise similarity to better measure identity preservation of fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for personalized generative models focus on overall semantic similarity but fail to capture fine-grained discriminative details that are crucial for identity preservation. There's a need for better evaluation methods that can assess whether generated images retain precise identity-specific details.

Method: Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view where generated images are treated as queries against an identity-labeled gallery of visually similar real images. It uses retrieval metrics like mean average precision to measure performance, with higher scores indicating better preservation of identity-specific details. The method assesses identity at multiple granularities from fine-grained categories to individual instances.

Result: The method was evaluated across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks. Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods.

Conclusion: The gallery-based protocol provides a principled and practical evaluation framework for personalized generation, offering better assessment of identity preservation than existing similarity-based metrics.

Abstract: The rise of personalized generative models raises a central question: how should we evaluate identity preservation? Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods.

*Ran Li,Pan Xiao,Kaushik Dutta,Youdong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bayesian Deep Learning framework for automatic detection of neuronal activities in 4D calcium imaging data, combining temporal correlation maps with spatial information to produce probability segmentation maps with uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of neuronal activities in fluorescence microscopy calcium imaging is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lacks generalizability, creating a bottleneck for studying brain activity mapping at single-cell resolution.

Method: Bayesian Deep Learning Framework that processes 4D spatio-temporal light sheet microscopy data by calculating pixel-wise correlation maps for temporal information and combining it with spatial information from mean summary images, producing probability segmentation maps with uncertainty modeling.

Result: Achieved mean Dice Score of 0.81 compared to synthetic Ground Truth (Otsu's method) and mean Dice Score of 0.79 for test reproducibility between first and second runs, demonstrating accurate and generalizable neuron activity detection.

Conclusion: The Bayesian framework enables rapid, automatic detection of active neuronal activities for behavioral studies with uncertainty quantification, overcoming manual segmentation limitations in calcium imaging analysis.

Abstract: Fluorescence Microcopy Calcium Imaging is a fundamental tool to in-vivo record and analyze large scale neuronal activities simultaneously at a single cell resolution. Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility. Our method successfully deployed can be used for rapid detection of active neuronal activities for behavioural studies.

*Xiaoyang Li,Mingming Lu,Ruiqi Wang,Hao Li,Zewei Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SPM framework addresses few-shot action recognition challenges through hierarchical motion refinement, semantic prototype modulation, and prototype-anchor dual modulation to improve temporal modeling, visual discrimination, and modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot action recognition faces three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling difficulties due to static background interference, (2) visual similarity between categories with subtle differences, and (3) modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries.

Method: Proposes CLIP-SPM framework with three components: (1) HSMR module aligns deep and shallow motion features to reduce static background interference, (2) SPM strategy generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge modality gap and enhance discrimination, (3) PADM method refines support prototypes and aligns query features with global semantic anchor.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51 benchmarks under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Ablation studies validate effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: CLIP-SPM effectively addresses core challenges in few-shot action recognition through synergistic motion refinement, semantic prototype modulation, and dual modulation alignment, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Extensive ablation studies and visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and its contributions to addressing the core challenges. The source code and models are publicly available at GitHub.

*Utae Jeong,Sumin In,Hyunju Ryu,Jaewan Choi,Feng Yang,Jongheon Jeong,Seungryong Kim,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaTeRFlow is a deep learning-based watermarking framework designed to maintain robust watermark recovery when watermarked images are converted to videos via image-to-video (I2V) generation, addressing the challenge of weakened per-frame detection in video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking schemes are vulnerable to distortions and generative edits, especially when watermarked images are converted to videos via I2V models. As I2V technology advances from short clips to multi-second coherent scenes and serves critical applications like world-modeling and simulation, robust cross-modal watermark recovery becomes crucial for maintaining authenticity and provenance.

Method: WaTeRFlow consists of three key components: (1) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine) that exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and fast video diffusion proxy during training, (2) optical-flow warping with Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) to stabilize per-frame predictions, and (3) semantic preservation loss to maintain the conditioning signal.

Result: Experiments across representative I2V models show accurate watermark recovery from frames, with higher first-frame and per-frame bit accuracy. The framework demonstrates resilience when various distortions are applied both before and after video generation.

Conclusion: WaTeRFlow successfully addresses the gap in cross-modal watermark recovery for I2V applications, providing robust watermark detection in video sequences generated from watermarked images, which is essential for authenticity and provenance in advanced content creation and simulation workflows.

Abstract: Image watermarking supports authenticity and provenance, yet many schemes are still easy to bypass with various distortions and powerful generative edits. Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal. Experiments across representative I2V models show accurate watermark recovery from frames, with higher first-frame and per-frame bit accuracy and resilience when various distortions are applied before or after video generation.

*Hwanhee Jung,Seunggwan Lee,Jeongyoon Yoon,SeungHyeon Kim,Giljoo Nam,Qixing Huang,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecHOI separates human-object interaction synthesis into trajectory planning and action generation, improving realism and flexibility without manual waypoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI synthesis methods require manual waypoints and combine all objectives in one network, leading to complexity, inflexibility, and errors like unsynchronized motion and penetration.

Method: Decoupled approach with trajectory generator for human/object paths without waypoints, action generator conditioned on trajectories, adversarial training with distal joint dynamics discriminator, and support for dynamic scenes with moving counterparts.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on FullBodyManipulation and 3D-FUTURE benchmarks across most quantitative metrics, qualitative evaluations, and perceptual studies.

Conclusion: DecHOI's decoupled generative modeling framework effectively addresses limitations of existing HOI synthesis approaches, producing more realistic and flexible human-object interactions.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interaction (HOI) is essential for 3D computer vision and robotics, underpinning animation and embodied control. Existing approaches often require manually specified intermediate waypoints and place all optimization objectives on a single network, which increases complexity, reduces flexibility, and leads to errors such as unsynchronized human and object motion or penetration. To address these issues, we propose Decoupled Generative Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (DecHOI), which separates path planning and action synthesis. A trajectory generator first produces human and object trajectories without prescribed waypoints, and an action generator conditions on these paths to synthesize detailed motions. To further improve contact realism, we employ adversarial training with a discriminator that focuses on the dynamics of distal joints. The framework also models a moving counterpart and supports responsive, long-sequence planning in dynamic scenes, while preserving plan consistency. Across two benchmarks, FullBodyManipulation and 3D-FUTURE, DecHOI surpasses prior methods on most quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, and perceptual studies likewise prefer our results.

*Jihui Guo,Zongmin Zhang,Zhen Sun,Yuhao Yang,Jinlin Wu,Fu Zhang,Xinlei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 6DAttack: First backdoor attack framework for 6DoF object pose estimation using 3D triggers to manipulate continuous pose parameters while maintaining normal performance on clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6DoF pose estimation is critical for robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems but vulnerable to backdoor attacks. While 2D vision backdoors have been studied, 6DoF attacks remain unexplored due to the challenge of controlling continuous pose parameters rather than just discrete classes.

Method: Proposes 6DAttack framework using 3D object triggers to induce controlled erroneous poses. The attack maintains normal behavior on clean data while manipulating translation and rotation parameters when triggers are present. Evaluated on PVNet, DenseFusion, and PoseDiffusion models across LINEMOD, YCB-Video, and CO3D datasets.

Result: High attack success rates (ASRs) without compromising clean performance. Backdoored models achieve up to 100% clean ADD accuracy and 100% ASR, with triggered samples reaching 97.70% ADD-P. A representative defense method remains ineffective against the attack.

Conclusion: 6DAttack reveals a serious, underexplored security threat to 6DoF pose estimation systems. The framework demonstrates that continuous pose parameters can be effectively manipulated through backdoor attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in critical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have enabled accurate six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) object pose estimation, widely used in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. However, backdoor attacks pose significant security risks. While most research focuses on 2D vision, 6DoF pose estimation remains largely unexplored. Unlike traditional backdoors that only change classes, 6DoF attacks must control continuous parameters like translation and rotation, rendering 2D methods inapplicable. We propose 6DAttack, a framework using 3D object triggers to induce controlled erroneous poses while maintaining normal behavior. Evaluations on PVNet, DenseFusion, and PoseDiffusion across LINEMOD, YCB-Video, and CO3D show high attack success rates (ASRs) without compromising clean performance. Backdoored models achieve up to 100% clean ADD accuracy and 100% ASR, with triggered samples reaching 97.70% ADD-P. Furthermore, a representative defense remains ineffective. Our findings reveal a serious, underexplored threat to 6DoF pose estimation.

*Ruiqi Ma,Yu Yan,Chunhong Zhang,Minghao Yin,XinChao Liu,Zhihong Jin,Zheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDD is a training-free method that reduces hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by enhancing images through segmentation and using blank images to eliminate language priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from severe hallucination issues in object recognition tasks, generating fluent but inaccurate text that doesn't correspond to visual content, which can have serious real-world consequences. Existing methods mostly focus only on language modality hallucinations.

Method: Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) enhances original images through segmentation and selects augmenting images, while using blank images to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both original and segmented images.

Result: HDD reduces model's dependence on language priors and enhances visual performance without requiring any training.

Conclusion: HDD effectively mitigates hallucinations in both language and visual modalities of LVLMs through a training-free approach that disentangles language priors from visual understanding.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) bridge the gap between visual and linguistic modalities, demonstrating strong potential across a variety of domains. However, despite significant progress, LVLMs still suffer from severe hallucination issues in object recognition tasks. These models often fail to accurately identify certain objects, leading to text generation that appears fluent but does not correspond to the visual content, which can have serious consequences in real-world applications. Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate LVLM hallucinations, but most focus solely on reducing hallucinations in the language modality. To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training. HDD enhances the original image by segmenting it and selecting images that augment the original, while also utilizing a blank image to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both the original and segmented images. This design not only reduces the model's dependence on language priors but also enhances its visual performance. (Code: https://github.com/rickeyhhh/Hallucination-Disentangled-Decoding)

*Khanh Nguyen,Dasith de Silva Edirimuni,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that generates 3D masks from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector, enabling fast retrieval of rare objects without SAM/CLIP dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation rely heavily on SAM and CLIP, causing computational overhead and slow processing. Open-YOLO 3D reduces this dependency but fails to generalize to infrequent object categories in 3D training data.

Method: Generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification.

Result: Enables fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP while improving generalization to infrequent object categories.

Conclusion: Proposes an efficient approach that combines 2D open-vocabulary detection with 3D mask generation, achieving better generalization to rare objects while maintaining real-time performance for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: Locating and retrieving objects from scene-level point clouds is a challenging problem with broad applications in robotics and augmented reality. This task is commonly formulated as open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time. However, Open-YOLO 3D often fails to generalize to object categories that appear infrequently in the 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a method that generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Our approach inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries.

TL;DR: RankInsight is an open-source toolkit that addresses three key limitations in medical AI leaderboards: lack of statistical significance testing, inappropriate single-metric averaging, and missing intersectional fairness analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI leaderboards have three persistent problems: (1) score gaps lack statistical significance testing, making rank stability unknown; (2) single averaged metrics applied to all organs hide clinically important boundary errors; (3) performance across intersecting demographics is seldom reported, masking fairness and equity gaps.

Method: RankInsight toolkit provides three key functionalities: (1) computes pair-wise significance maps to test statistical certainty of performance differences; (2) recomputes leaderboards with organ-appropriate metrics (e.g., replacing Dice with NSD for tubular structures); (3) audits intersectional fairness across demographic groups.

Result: Application shows: (1) nnU-Net family outperforms Vision-Language and MONAI submissions with high statistical certainty; (2) top four models' order reverses when Dice is replaced by NSD for tubular structures; (3) more than half of MONAI-based entries show largest gender-race discrepancy on proprietary Johns Hopkins Hospital dataset.

Conclusion: RankInsight enables medical AI challenge organizers and participants to publish rankings that are statistically sound, clinically meaningful, and demographically fair, addressing critical limitations in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Open challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative ranking of medical AI methods. Despite their importance, medical AI leaderboards exhibit three persistent limitations: (1) score gaps are rarely tested for statistical significance, so rank stability is unknown; (2) single averaged metrics are applied to every organ, hiding clinically important boundary errors; (3) performance across intersecting demographics is seldom reported, masking fairness and equity gaps. We introduce RankInsight, an open-source toolkit that seeks to address these limitations. RankInsight (1) computes pair-wise significance maps that show the nnU-Net family outperforms Vision-Language and MONAI submissions with high statistical certainty; (2) recomputes leaderboards with organ-appropriate metrics, reversing the order of the top four models when Dice is replaced by NSD for tubular structures; and (3) audits intersectional fairness, revealing that more than half of the MONAI-based entries have the largest gender-race discrepancy on our proprietary Johns Hopkins Hospital dataset. The RankInsight toolkit is publicly released and can be directly applied to past, ongoing, and future challenges. It enables organizers and participants to publish rankings that are statistically sound, clinically meaningful, and demographically fair.

TL;DR: MambaMDN: A dual-domain framework using Mamba-based modality disentanglement and iterative refinement for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged MRI scan times hinder patient throughput and comfort. Existing accelerated MRI techniques fail to effectively utilize K-space prior information (causing aliasing artifacts) and suffer from irrelevant information contamination in multi-contrast fusion strategies.

Method: 1) Uses fully-sampled reference K-space data to complete undersampled target data, creating structurally aligned but modality-mixed inputs. 2) Develops Mamba-based modality disentanglement network to extract and remove reference-specific features. 3) Introduces iterative refinement mechanism for progressive reconstruction enhancement through repeated feature purification.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaMDN significantly outperforms existing multi-contrast MRI reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MambaMDN effectively addresses key challenges in accelerated MRI by leveraging K-space prior information while preventing contamination from irrelevant multi-contrast features, offering improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnosis, offering unparalleled soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. However, prolonged scan times remain a major barrier to patient throughput and comfort. Existing accelerated MRI techniques often struggle with two key challenges: (1) failure to effectively utilize inherent K-space prior information, leading to persistent aliasing artifacts from zero-filled inputs; and (2) contamination of target reconstruction quality by irrelevant information when employing multi-contrast fusion strategies. To overcome these challenges, we present MambaMDN, a dual-domain framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. Our approach first employs fully-sampled reference K-space data to complete the undersampled target data, generating structurally aligned but modality-mixed inputs. Subsequently, we develop a Mamba-based modality disentanglement network to extract and remove reference-specific features from the mixed representation. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative refinement mechanism to progressively enhance reconstruction accuracy through repeated feature purification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaMDN can significantly outperform existing multi-contrast reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianImage++ improves 2D Gaussian Splatting for image representation/compression with distortion-driven densification, context-aware filters, and efficient quantization, outperforming previous methods with real-time decoding and low memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have high training time/memory requirements, while existing 2D Gaussian Splatting methods need excessive primitives for high fidelity. There's a need for efficient primitive-based rendering that balances quality with resource usage.

Method: Three key techniques: 1) Distortion-driven densification that progressively allocates Gaussian primitives based on signal intensity; 2) Context-aware Gaussian filters for each primitive to optimize based on image content; 3) Attribute-separated learnable scalar quantizers with quantization-aware training for efficient compression.

Result: Outperforms GaussianImage and INRs-based COIN in both representation and compression performance while maintaining real-time decoding and low memory usage.

Conclusion: GaussianImage++ successfully addresses limitations of both INRs and previous GS methods by achieving high-quality image representation/compression with efficient primitive usage, real-time decoding, and low memory requirements.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable success in image representation and compression, but they require substantial training time and memory. Meanwhile, recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods (\textit{e.g.}, GaussianImage) offer promising alternatives through efficient primitive-based rendering. However, these methods require excessive Gaussian primitives to maintain high visual fidelity. To exploit the potential of GS-based approaches, we present GaussianImage++, which utilizes limited Gaussian primitives to achieve impressive representation and compression performance. Firstly, we introduce a distortion-driven densification mechanism. It progressively allocates Gaussian primitives according to signal intensity. Secondly, we employ context-aware Gaussian filters for each primitive, which assist in the densification to optimize Gaussian primitives based on varying image content. Thirdly, we integrate attribute-separated learnable scalar quantizers and quantization-aware training, enabling efficient compression of primitive attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, GaussianImage++ outperforms GaussianImage and INRs-based COIN in representation and compression performance while maintaining real-time decoding and low memory usage.

TL;DR: Novel solvers for relative pose estimation with known vertical directions using IMU data, requiring only 4 or 3 point correspondences for efficient RANSAC-based outlier removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical directions from IMUs are widely available in autonomous vehicles, phones, and UAVs. Leveraging this known information can simplify pose estimation problems and reduce computational requirements.

Method: Two solvers: 1) Linear closed-form solution requiring 4 point correspondences across 3 views, 2) Minimal solution using Gröbner basis solver requiring only 3 point correspondences. Both exploit known vertical directions to reduce unknowns to two rotation angles and two translation vectors.

Result: Tested on synthetic data and KITTI real-world scenes. The proposed methods show superior accuracy compared to alternative methods while requiring fewer point correspondences.

Conclusion: The proposed solvers efficiently estimate relative poses using known vertical directions, enabling effective RANSAC-based outlier removal in visual odometry with reduced computational requirements and improved accuracy.

Abstract: This work presents two novel solvers for estimating the relative poses among views with known vertical directions. The vertical directions of camera views can be easily obtained using inertial measurement units (IMUs) which have been widely used in autonomous vehicles, mobile phones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Given the known vertical directions, our lgorithms only need to solve for two rotation angles and two translation vectors. In this paper, a linear closed-form solution has been described, requiring only four point correspondences in three views. We also propose a minimal solution with three point correspondences using the latest Gröbner basis solver. Since the proposed methods require fewer point correspondences, they can be efficiently applied within the RANSAC framework for outliers removal and pose estimation in visual odometry. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic data and real-world scenes from KITTI. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the estimated poses is superior to other alternative methods.

*Hengyi Feng,Zeang Sheng,Meiyi Qiang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with multimodal retrieval due to text-dominated representations and homogenized embeddings that reduce discriminative power, despite excelling at generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform poorly at zero-shot multimodal retrieval despite their success in generative tasks, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms hindering their effectiveness as retrievers.

Method: Used sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose MLLM output representations into interpretable semantic concepts, analyzing the composition and behavior of the representation space to probe intrinsic model behavior.

Result: MLLM representations are overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics, with visual information constituting only a small portion. The focus on bridging image-text modalities homogenizes embeddings, reducing discriminative power. Specific feature components that contribute most to similarity computations actually degrade retrieval performance.

Conclusion: This work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations for multimodal retrieval, revealing fundamental limitations in current architectures and offering directions for enhancing their retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in generative tasks, we observe that they exhibit a counterintuitive deficiency in the zero-shot multimodal retrieval task. In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanisms that hinder MLLMs from serving as effective retrievers. With the help of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we decompose MLLM output representations into interpretable semantic concepts to probe their intrinsic behavior. Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMap introduces a "distill-from-future" paradigm for online HD map construction that enables current-frame models to have "look-ahead" capabilities by transferring knowledge from future-aware teacher models, improving forward region perception critical for autonomous driving safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current temporal fusion methods for HD map construction are "spatially backward-looking" - they improve perception in traversed areas but offer minimal improvement for the unseen road ahead. This creates a critical safety gap since forward region inaccuracies directly cause hazardous driving maneuvers, while rearward errors are often tolerable.

Method: Proposes AMap with a "distill-from-future" paradigm: a teacher model with privileged access to future temporal contexts guides a lightweight student model restricted to the current frame. Uses Multi-Level BEV Distillation with spatial masking and an Asymmetric Query Adaptation module to transfer future-aware representations to the student's static queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks show AMap significantly enhances current-frame perception. It outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models in critical forward regions while maintaining the efficiency of single current frame inference.

Conclusion: AMap bridges the safety gap in online HD map construction by enabling "look-ahead" capabilities at zero inference-time cost, addressing the critical asymmetry where forward region perception is most important for autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Online High-Definition (HD) map construction is pivotal for autonomous driving. While recent approaches leverage historical temporal fusion to improve performance, we identify a critical safety flaw in this paradigm: it is inherently ``spatially backward-looking." These methods predominantly enhance map reconstruction in traversed areas, offering minimal improvement for the unseen road ahead. Crucially, our analysis of downstream planning tasks reveals a severe asymmetry: while rearward perception errors are often tolerable, inaccuracies in the forward region directly precipitate hazardous driving maneuvers. To bridge this safety gap, we propose AMap, a novel framework for Ahead-aware online HD Mapping. We pioneer a ``distill-from-future" paradigm, where a teacher model with privileged access to future temporal contexts guides a lightweight student model restricted to the current frame. This process implicitly compresses prospective knowledge into the student model, endowing it with ``look-ahead" capabilities at zero inference-time cost. Technically, we introduce a Multi-Level BEV Distillation strategy with spatial masking and an Asymmetric Query Adaptation module to effectively transfer future-aware representations to the student's static queries. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that AMap significantly enhances current-frame perception. Most notably, it outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models in critical forward regions while maintaining the efficiency of single current frame inference.

TL;DR: OmniMoGen is a unified LLM-like framework for human motion generation that supports versatile tasks through interleaved text-motion instructions, achieving SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have unified diverse linguistic tasks, motion generation methods remain confined to isolated tasks, limiting flexibility for free-form and omni-objective generation. The authors aim to create a unified framework similar to LLMs for motion generation.

Method: Built on a concise RVQ-VAE and transformer architecture, OmniMoGen enables end-to-end instruction-driven motion generation. The authors construct X2Mo (137K+ interleaved text-motion instructions dataset) and introduce AnyContext benchmark for evaluation.

Result: OmniMoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion, motion editing, and the new AnyContext benchmark. It exhibits emerging capabilities including compositional editing, self-reflective generation, and knowledge-informed generation.

Conclusion: OmniMoGen represents a significant step toward next-generation intelligent motion generation by unifying diverse motion tasks within a single framework, similar to how LLMs unified language tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unified diverse linguistic tasks within a single framework, yet such unification remains unexplored in human motion generation. Existing methods are confined to isolated tasks, limiting flexibility for free-form and omni-objective generation. To address this, we propose OmniMoGen, a unified framework that enables versatile motion generation through interleaved text-motion instructions. Built upon a concise RVQ-VAE and transformer architecture, OmniMoGen supports end-to-end instruction-driven motion generation. We construct X2Mo, a large-scale dataset of over 137K interleaved text-motion instructions, and introduce AnyContext, a benchmark for evaluating interleaved motion generation. Experiments show that OmniMoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion, motion editing, and AnyContext, exhibiting emerging capabilities such as compositional editing, self-reflective generation, and knowledge-informed generation. These results mark a step toward the next intelligent motion generation. Project Page: https://OmniMoGen.github.io/.

TL;DR: Introduces PEDESTRIAN dataset - egocentric videos of 29 sidewalk obstacles for training deep learning models to enhance pedestrian safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sidewalk obstacles pose safety hazards to pedestrians, but current systems lack comprehensive egocentric datasets for training effective obstacle detection algorithms.

Method: Collected 340 egocentric videos using mobile phone cameras capturing pedestrian's point of view, covering 29 different sidewalk obstacles. Used this dataset to train several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.

Result: Created the PEDESTRIAN dataset as a benchmark for obstacle detection and recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for training pavement obstacle detectors.

Conclusion: The PEDESTRIAN dataset enables development of real-time obstacle detection systems using egocentric vision, potentially enhancing pedestrian safety in urban environments.

Abstract: Walking has always been a primary mode of transportation and is recognized as an essential activity for maintaining good health. Despite the need for safe walking conditions in urban environments, sidewalks are frequently obstructed by various obstacles that hinder free pedestrian movement. Any object obstructing a pedestrian's path can pose a safety hazard. The advancement of pervasive computing and egocentric vision techniques offers the potential to design systems that can automatically detect such obstacles in real time, thereby enhancing pedestrian safety. The development of effective and efficient identification algorithms relies on the availability of comprehensive and well-balanced datasets of egocentric data. In this work, we introduce the PEDESTRIAN dataset, comprising egocentric data for 29 different obstacles commonly found on urban sidewalks. A total of 340 videos were collected using mobile phone cameras, capturing a pedestrian's point of view. Additionally, we present the results of a series of experiments that involved training several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms using the proposed dataset, which can be used as a benchmark for obstacle detection and recognition tasks. The dataset can be used for training pavement obstacle detectors to enhance the safety of pedestrians in urban areas.

*Zihao Luo,Shaohao Rui,Zhenyu Tang,Guotai Wang,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InvCoSS is a privacy-preserving continual self-supervised learning framework for medical imaging that uses model inversion to generate synthetic data instead of replaying real data, preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual self-supervised learning methods in medical imaging rely on replaying real data from previous stages, which compromises data privacy and limits real-world applicability due to data transfer restrictions across medical sites.

Method: InvCoSS inverts pre-trained self-supervised models to generate synthetic images approximating original training distributions. It uses a novel InvUNet with multi-scale fusion to restore image fidelity, and a repulsive representation-learning mechanism to enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks show InvCoSS achieves performance comparable to or superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints.

Conclusion: InvCoSS provides an effective privacy-preserving solution for continual self-supervised learning in medical imaging, enabling sequential training without access to previous real data while maintaining performance and addressing practical deployment constraints.

Abstract: Continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) in medical imaging trains a foundation model sequentially, alleviating the need for collecting multi-modal images for joint training and offering promising improvements in downstream performance while preserving data privacy. However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance. Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of InvCoSS, achieving performance comparable to or even superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HippMetric: A skeletal representation framework for hippocampal substructure analysis that establishes stable anatomical correspondence across subjects and time using a biologically-grounded coordinate system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hippocampal analysis methods lack stable intrinsic coordinate systems to handle high inter-subject variability and complex folding patterns, limiting reliable cross-subject and longitudinal correspondence needed for detecting subtle neurodegenerative changes.

Method: HippMetric uses Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) with deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy. It has two modules: 1) skeletal-based coordinate system respecting longitudinal lamellar architecture, and 2) individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on two international cohorts show HippMetric achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and correspondence stability compared to existing shape models.

Conclusion: HippMetric provides a biologically grounded framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry with stable point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans, enabling more reliable neurodegenerative biomarker detection.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of hippocampal substructure is crucial for detecting subtle structural changes and identifying early neurodegenerative biomarkers. However, high inter-subject variability and complex folding pattern of human hippocampus hinder consistent cross-subject and longitudinal analysis. Most existing approaches rely on subject-specific modelling and lack a stable intrinsic coordinate system to accommodate anatomical variability, which limits their ability to establish reliable inter- and intra-individual correspondence. To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry. Extensive experiments on two international cohorts demonstrate that HippMetric achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and correspondence stability compared to existing shape models.

*Tiange Luo,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Jaekyeom Kim,Justin Johnson,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image-LoRA is a lightweight PEFT method for vision-language models that applies low-rank adaptation only to value paths in visual-token attention layers, reduces training FLOPs proportionally to visual-token fraction, and uses head selection with normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for vision-language models that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance, and preserves the original model's text reasoning capabilities after fine-tuning.

Method: Image-LoRA applies low-rank adaptation only to the value path of attention layers within visual-token spans, selects a subset of attention heads using influence scores estimated with rank-1 Image-LoRA, and stabilizes updates via selection-size normalization.

Result: Matches or closely approaches standard LoRA accuracy across screen-centric grounding and referring benchmarks (text-heavy to image-heavy regimes) while using fewer trainable parameters and lower adapter-only training FLOPs. Preserves pure-text reasoning performance on GSM8K.

Conclusion: Image-LoRA provides an efficient fine-tuning approach for VLMs that maintains performance while reducing computational costs and preserving original text reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Image-LoRA, a lightweight parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) recipe for transformer-based vision-language models (VLMs). Image-LoRA applies low-rank adaptation only to the value path of attention layers within the visual-token span, reducing adapter-only training FLOPs roughly in proportion to the visual-token fraction. We further adapt only a subset of attention heads, selected using head influence scores estimated with a rank-1 Image-LoRA, and stabilize per-layer updates via selection-size normalization. Across screen-centric grounding and referring benchmarks spanning text-heavy to image-heavy regimes, Image-LoRA matches or closely approaches standard LoRA accuracy while using fewer trainable parameters and lower adapter-only training FLOPs. The method also preserves the pure-text reasoning performance of VLMs before and after fine-tuning, as further shown on GSM8K.

*Yunlong Liu,Shuyang Li,Pengyuan Liu,Yu Zhang,Rudi Stouffs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a three-stage graph-based pipeline using scene graphs to predict urban perception from street view imagery, achieving 26% better accuracy than image-only baselines with strong cross-city generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception research using streetscapes relies on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking explicit relations that shape human perception. There's a need for more structured, interpretable approaches that capture relational patterns in urban scenes.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Open-set Panoptic Scene Graph (OpenPSG) extracts object-predicate-object triplets from street view imagery; 2) Heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE) learns compact scene-level embeddings; 3) Neural network predicts six perceptual indicators from these embeddings.

Result: The approach improves perception prediction accuracy by average 26% over baseline models, maintains strong generalization in cross-city prediction tasks, and identifies specific relational patterns (like "graffiti on wall" and "car parked on sidewalk") that contribute to lower perception scores.

Conclusion: Graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modeling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics by clarifying which relational patterns affect perception scores.

Abstract: Perception research is increasingly modelled using streetscapes, yet many approaches still rely on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking the explicit relations that shape human perception. This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionDirector is a training-free vision-language supervisor that improves generative models' ability to handle long, multi-goal prompts by extracting structured goals, dynamically planning edit strategies, and using semantic verification with rollback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with long, multi-goal prompts that professional designers use, missing localized edits and failing to satisfy complex requirements. There's a need to evaluate and improve models' performance in real-world design scenarios.

Method: VisionDirector extracts structured goals from long instructions, dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and logs goal-level rewards. It's further fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: VisionDirector achieves new SOTA on GenEval (+7% overall) and ImgEdit (+0.07 absolute), reduces edit trajectories from 4.2 to 3.1 steps, and shows consistent qualitative improvements on typography, multi-object scenes, and pose editing.

Conclusion: The paper introduces LGBench to expose current models' limitations with complex prompts and presents VisionDirector as an effective solution that significantly improves performance on long, multi-goal generation tasks through structured goal extraction and intelligent edit planning.

Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic imagery, yet they still struggle with the long, multi-goal prompts that professional designers issue. To expose this gap and better evaluate models' performance in real-world settings, we introduce Long Goal Bench (LGBench), a 2,000-task suite (1,000 T2I and 1,000 I2I) whose average instruction contains 18 to 22 tightly coupled goals spanning global layout, local object placement, typography, and logo fidelity. We find that even state-of-the-art models satisfy fewer than 72 percent of the goals and routinely miss localized edits, confirming the brittleness of current pipelines. To address this, we present VisionDirector, a training-free vision-language supervisor that (i) extracts structured goals from long instructions, (ii) dynamically decides between one-shot generation and staged edits, (iii) runs micro-grid sampling with semantic verification and rollback after every edit, and (iv) logs goal-level rewards. We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment. VisionDirector achieves new state of the art on GenEval (plus 7 percent overall) and ImgEdit (plus 0.07 absolute) while producing consistent qualitative improvements on typography, multi-object scenes, and pose editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3SGen is a unified framework that handles subject, style, and structure conditioning in image generation using an MLLM with semantic queries, VAE for details, and an Adaptive Task-specific Memory module to disentangle and manage condition-specific priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation approaches handle subject, style, and structure conditioning separately, causing feature entanglement and limited task transferability. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle all three conditioning modes effectively.

Method: 3SGen uses an MLLM with learnable semantic queries for text-image alignment, a VAE branch for visual detail preservation, and an Adaptive Task-specific Memory (ATM) module with lightweight gating and scalable memory items to dynamically disentangle, store, and retrieve condition-specific priors (identity for subjects, textures for styles, spatial layouts for structures).

Result: The paper demonstrates superior performance on the proposed 3SGen-Bench benchmark and other public benchmarks across diverse image-driven generation tasks, showing effective cross-task fidelity and controllability.

Conclusion: 3SGen successfully addresses the limitations of isolated conditioning approaches by providing a unified framework that mitigates inter-task interference, scales to compositional inputs, and achieves strong performance across multiple image generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent image generation approaches often address subject, style, and structure-driven conditioning in isolation, leading to feature entanglement and limited task transferability. In this paper, we introduce 3SGen, a task-aware unified framework that performs all three conditioning modes within a single model. 3SGen employs an MLLM equipped with learnable semantic queries to align text-image semantics, complemented by a VAE branch that preserves fine-grained visual details. At its core, an Adaptive Task-specific Memory (ATM) module dynamically disentangles, stores, and retrieves condition-specific priors, such as identity for subjects, textures for styles, and spatial layouts for structures, via a lightweight gating mechanism along with several scalable memory items. This design mitigates inter-task interference and naturally scales to compositional inputs. In addition, we propose 3SGen-Bench, a unified image-driven generation benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating cross-task fidelity and controllability. Extensive experiments on our proposed 3SGen-Bench and other public benchmarks demonstrate our superior performance across diverse image-driven generation tasks.

*Ivan DeAndres-Tame,Chengwei Ye,Ruben Tolosana,Ruben Vera-Rodriguez,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current GenAI models for human animation produce visually high-quality results but fail to preserve subtle gait biometrics needed for person identification, revealing they rely on visual attributes rather than temporal motion patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GenAI models can generate realistic human animation, they struggle with preserving subtle motion cues essential for behavioral biometrics like gait recognition. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art models can maintain the spatio-temporal details necessary for person identification through gait.

Method: Evaluated four different GenAI models across two primary tasks: 1) restoring gait patterns from reference videos under varying complexity conditions, and 2) transferring gait patterns to different visual identities. Used identity transfer tasks to examine how models handle disentanglement of identity from motion.

Result: Visual quality was mostly high, but biometric fidelity remained low for identification tasks. Models struggled to disentangle identity from motion. Identity transfer tasks revealed a fundamental flaw: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, showing current models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: Current GenAI human animation models cannot preserve the subtle gait patterns needed for reliable person identification. They fail to capture temporal dynamics essential for behavioral biometrics, instead relying on visual attributes, which limits their effectiveness for applications requiring accurate motion pattern preservation.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) models have revolutionized animation, enabling the synthesis of humans and motion patterns with remarkable visual fidelity. However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaMoS: A hand-aware diffusion framework for estimating full-body motion from egocentric videos using head trajectories and intermittent hand cues, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric vision systems are becoming widely available but estimating full-body motion from first-person videos is challenging because most body parts are invisible. Prior approaches rely too heavily on head trajectories (ambiguous) or assume continuously tracked hands (unrealistic for lightweight devices).

Method: HaMoS is a hand-aware, sequence-level diffusion framework that conditions on both head trajectory and intermittently visible hand cues. Uses novel augmentation to model real-world conditions (field-of-view limitations and occlusions). Employs local attention to efficiently infer long sequences while considering body shape and field-of-view contexts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal smoothness on public benchmarks, demonstrating practical progress toward reliable in-the-wild egocentric 3D motion understanding.

Conclusion: HaMoS represents a practical step toward reliable egocentric 3D motion understanding by effectively leveraging intermittent hand cues and sequence-level contexts, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Egocentric vision systems are becoming widely available, creating new opportunities for human-computer interaction. A core challenge is estimating the wearer's full-body motion from first-person videos, which is crucial for understanding human behavior. However, this task is difficult since most body parts are invisible from the egocentric view. Prior approaches mainly rely on head trajectories, leading to ambiguity, or assume continuously tracked hands, which is unrealistic for lightweight egocentric devices. In this work, we present HaMoS, the first hand-aware, sequence-level diffusion framework that directly conditions on both head trajectory and intermittently visible hand cues caused by field-of-view limitations and occlusions, as in real-world egocentric devices. To overcome the lack of datasets pairing diverse camera views with human motion, we introduce a novel augmentation method that models such real-world conditions. We also demonstrate that sequence-level contexts such as body shape and field-of-view are crucial for accurate motion reconstruction, and thus employ local attention to infer long sequences efficiently. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal smoothness, demonstrating a practical step toward reliable in-the-wild egocentric 3D motion understanding.

TL;DR: RMLer is a reinforcement learning framework for cross-category concept fusion in text-to-image generation that uses dynamic mixing strategies and visual rewards to create coherent novel objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generation methods struggle with synthesizing novel objects by integrating distinct textual concepts from different categories, often producing insufficient concept mixing, conceptual imbalance, superficial combinations, or mere juxtapositions.

Method: RMLer formulates concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Uses MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending text embeddings, with visual rewards based on semantic similarity and compositional balance, optimized via proximal policy optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods in cross-category concept fusion.

Conclusion: RMLer provides a robust framework for generating novel visual concepts with promising applications in film, gaming, and design, addressing key limitations in current text-to-image generation for cross-category concept fusion.

Abstract: Novel object synthesis by integrating distinct textual concepts from diverse categories remains a significant challenge in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. Existing methods often suffer from insufficient concept mixing, lack of rigorous evaluation, and suboptimal outputs-manifesting as conceptual imbalance, superficial combinations, or mere juxtapositions. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods. Our work provides a robust framework for generating novel visual concepts, with promising applications in film, gaming, and design.

TL;DR: Think2Seg-RS is a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control SAM via geometric prompts, achieving SOTA on EarthReason and zero-shot generalization to referring segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLM reasoning segmentation frameworks couple linguistic reasoning and pixel prediction through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning, leading to weak geometric grounding and limited generalization across tasks.

Method: Developed a decoupled framework with an LVLM prompter that controls a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts, using mask-only reinforcement learning to translate semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on EarthReason dataset, with learned prompting policy generalizing zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, revealing a divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding.

Conclusion: Establishes semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold great promise for advancing remote sensing (RS) analysis, yet existing reasoning segmentation frameworks couple linguistic reasoning and pixel prediction through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning, leading to weak geometric grounding and limited generalization across tasks. To address this, we developed Think2Seg-RS, a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts. Through a mask-only reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset. Remarkably, the learned prompting policy generalizes zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, exposing a distinct divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding. We further found that compact segmenters outperform larger ones under semantic-level supervision, and that negative prompts are ineffective in heterogeneous aerial backgrounds. Together, these findings establish semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation.

*Hui Li,Jiayue Lyu,Fu-Yun Wang,Kaihui Cheng,Siyu Zhu,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixFlow addresses exposure bias in diffusion models by using slowed timestep interpolations to better align training and testing inputs, improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the training-testing discrepancy (exposure bias) in diffusion models where training uses ground-truth noisy data interpolations while testing uses generated noisy data, leading to performance degradation.

Method: MixFlow leverages the "Slow Flow" phenomenon where generated noisy data at a sampling timestep corresponds to ground-truth interpolations at higher-noise (slowed) timesteps. The method uses slowed interpolation mixtures for post-training the prediction network at each training timestep.

Result: Experiments on class-conditional image generation (SiT, REPA, RAE) and text-to-image generation show effectiveness. RAE models with MixFlow achieve strong results: 1.43 FID (unguided) and 1.10 FID (guided) at 256×256, and 1.55 FID (unguided) and 1.10 FID (guided) at 512×512 on ImageNet.

Conclusion: MixFlow effectively mitigates exposure bias in diffusion models by aligning training and testing distributions through slowed timestep interpolations, leading to improved generation quality across various model architectures and tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies the training-testing discrepancy (a.k.a. exposure bias) problem for improving the diffusion models. During training, the input of a prediction network at one training timestep is the corresponding ground-truth noisy data that is an interpolation of the noise and the data, and during testing, the input is the generated noisy data. We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512.

TL;DR: NIHCs is a neural implicit coordinate system for standardized cardiac anatomy reconstruction from sparse 2D segmentations, achieving high accuracy and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D cardiac reconstruction from sparse clinical images is challenging, and existing neural implicit methods lack anatomical consistency across subjects.

Method: Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs) - a standardized implicit coordinate system based on universal ventricular coordinates that provides common anatomical reference. Predicts NIHCs from sparse 2D segmentations and decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes.

Result: Achieves mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51±0.33 mm (diseased cohort, n=4549) and 2.3±0.36 mm (healthy cohort, n=5576). Enables anatomically coherent reconstruction under severe slice sparsity and noise. Reduces inference time from over 60s to 5-15s.

Conclusion: NIHCs provide a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data, enabling accurate recovery of complex structures like valve planes.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of cardiac anatomy from sparse clinical images remains a major challenge in patient-specific modeling. While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data.

*Moamal Fadhil Abdul,Jonas Bruun Hubrechts,Thomas Martini Jørgensen,Emil Hovad*

TL;DR: Extended OpenTTGames dataset with detailed stroke type annotations, player posture labels, and rally outcome tags for fine-grained table tennis video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable automatic stroke detection and classification in table tennis videos for training, broadcasting, and performance analytics by providing annotated video data that addresses the gap of publicly available, well-licensed datasets in the community.

Method: Extended the existing OpenTTGames dataset by adding frame-accurate shot type annotations (forehand/backhand subtypes), player posture labels (body lean, leg stance), and rally outcome tags. Developed a compact coding scheme and code-assisted labeling procedure for reproducible annotations.

Result: Created an enhanced dataset that moves beyond basic event spotting toward tactical understanding, allowing models to analyze whether strokes are likely to win points or create advantages. The annotations are released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

Conclusion: This work fills a practical gap in table tennis video analysis by providing detailed, publicly available annotations that support reproducible research and benchmarking for fine-grained stroke understanding in racket sports.

Abstract: Automatically detecting and classifying strokes in table tennis video can streamline training workflows, enrich broadcast overlays, and enable fine-grained performance analytics. For this to be possible, annotated video data of table tennis is needed. We extend the public OpenTTGames dataset with highly detailed, frame-accurate shot type annotations (forehand, backhand with subtypes), player posture labels (body lean and leg stance), and rally outcome tags at point end. OpenTTGames is a set of recordings from the side of the table with official labels for bounces, when the ball is above the net, or hitting the net. The dataset already contains ball coordinates near events, which are either "bounce", "net", or "empty_event" in the original OpenTTGames dataset, and semantic masks (humans, table, scoreboard). Our extension adds the types of stroke to the events and a per-player taxonomy so models can move beyond event spotting toward tactical understanding (e.g., whether a stroke is likely to win the point or set up an advantage). We provide a compact coding scheme and code-assisted labeling procedure to support reproducible annotations and baselines for fine-grained stroke understanding in racket sports. This fills a practical gap in the community, where many prior video resources are either not publicly released or carry restrictive/unclear licenses that hinder reuse and benchmarking. Our annotations are released under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license as OpenTTGames, allowing free non-commercial use, modification, and redistribution, with appropriate attribution.

*Yueting Zhu,Yuehao Song,Shuai Zhang,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeltaMIL is a novel MIL framework for WSI analysis that uses gated delta rule to filter redundant information and integrate discriminative features, achieving SOTA performance on survival prediction and slide classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSIs are large and heterogeneous, generating redundant/dispersed information that makes it hard to identify discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches.

Method: DeltaMIL uses gated delta rule with forgetting and memory mechanisms to filter and integrate information. Delta mechanism dynamically updates memory by removing old values and inserting new ones based on correlation. Gating enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Also includes local pattern mixing to retain fine-grained pathological locality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: For survival prediction, improves by 3.69% with ResNet-50 features and 2.36% with UNI features. For slide-level classification, increases accuracy by 3.09% with ResNet-50 and 3.75% with UNI features.

Conclusion: DeltaMIL effectively enhances meaningful cue extraction while suppressing redundant/noisy information, improving model robustness and discriminative power across diverse WSI tasks with consistent strong performance.

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.

TL;DR: GANeXt: A 3D patch-based ConvNeXt-powered GAN for unified CT synthesis from MRI and CBCT across different anatomical regions without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT synthesis from MRI and CBCT is critical for clinical treatment planning in adaptive radiotherapy, enabling accurate anatomical representation when CT scans are unavailable or to reduce radiation exposure.

Method: Proposes GANeXt: 3D patch-based GAN with U-shaped generator using stacked 3D ConvNeXt blocks, conditional PatchGAN discriminator, and multi-loss function combining MAE, perceptual loss, segmentation-based masked MAE, adversarial loss, and multi-head segmentation discriminator with Dice/CE losses.

Result: Models trained for 3000 epochs (MRI-to-CT) and 1000 epochs (CBCT-to-CT) on full training dataset without fine-tuning, using sliding-window inference with 0.8 overlap and average folding for full-size synthetic CT reconstruction.

Conclusion: GANeXt provides a unified framework for CT synthesis across different modalities (MRI, CBCT) and anatomical regions, demonstrating potential for clinical treatment planning in adaptive radiotherapy through efficient 3D ConvNeXt architecture and comprehensive loss functions.

Abstract: The synthesis of computed tomography (CT) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays a critical role in clinical treatment planning by enabling accurate anatomical representation in adaptive radiotherapy. In this work, we propose GANeXt, a 3D patch-based, fully ConvNeXt-powered generative adversarial network for unified CT synthesis across different modalities and anatomical regions. Specifically, GANeXt employs an efficient U-shaped generator constructed from stacked 3D ConvNeXt blocks with compact convolution kernels, while the discriminator adopts a conditional PatchGAN. To improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a combination of loss functions, including mean absolute error (MAE), perceptual loss, segmentation-based masked MAE, and adversarial loss and a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy for multi-head segmentation discriminator. For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\times10^{-4}$ and $1\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$. Data augmentation involves random zooming within $(0.8, 1.3)$ (for MRI-to-CT only), fixed-size cropping to $32\times160\times192$ for MRI-to-CT and $32\times128\times128$ for CBCT-to-CT, and random flipping. During inference, we apply a sliding-window approach with $0.8$ overlap and average folding to reconstruct the full-size sCT, followed by inversion of the CT normalization. After joint training on all regions without any fine-tuning, the final models are selected at the end of 3000 epochs for MRI-to-CT and 1000 epochs for CBCT-to-CT using the full training dataset.

*Zhenyang Huang,Xiao Yu,Yi Zhang,Decheng Wang,Hang Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReasonCD: A multimodal reasoning change detection model that uses LLMs to mine implicit user intent from text descriptions, enabling flexible change detection without explicit CRoI specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing change detection methods rely too heavily on explicit textual descriptions of change regions of interest (CRoI), failing when users provide implicit descriptions. There's a need for models that can understand and reason about users' implicit task intentions.

Method: Proposes ReasonCD model that leverages pre-trained large language models' reasoning capabilities to mine users' implicit task intents from text. The model then generates different change detection results based on these inferred intents, enabling flexible detection without explicit CRoI specifications.

Result: Achieves excellent performance with 92.1% F1 score on BCDD dataset. Also demonstrates superior reasoning functionality on annotated SECOND dataset subset, showing capability for both basic reasoning-based change detection and providing explanations to aid human decision-making.

Conclusion: ReasonCD successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by mining implicit user intent through LLM reasoning, enabling robust change detection performance even with implicit textual descriptions and providing explainable reasoning processes.

Abstract: Remote sensing image change detection is one of the fundamental tasks in remote sensing intelligent interpretation. Its core objective is to identify changes within change regions of interest (CRoI). Current multimodal large models encode rich human semantic knowledge, which is utilized for guidance in tasks such as remote sensing change detection. However, existing methods that use semantic guidance for detecting users' CRoI overly rely on explicit textual descriptions of CRoI, leading to the problem of near-complete performance failure when presented with implicit CRoI textual descriptions. This paper proposes a multimodal reasoning change detection model named ReasonCD, capable of mining users' implicit task intent. The model leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models to mine users' implicit task intents and subsequently obtains different change detection results based on these intents. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the model achieves excellent change detection performance, with an F1 score of 92.1\% on the BCDD dataset. Furthermore, to validate its superior reasoning functionality, this paper annotates a subset of reasoning data based on the SECOND dataset. Experimental results show that the model not only excels at basic reasoning-based change detection tasks but can also explain the reasoning process to aid human decision-making.

*Zhongwei Chen,Hai-Jun Rong,Zhao-Xu Yang,Guoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeViMFormer is the first spiking neural network framework for drone-view geo-localization, achieving competitive performance with ANN methods while offering lower power consumption through spike-driven computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ANN-based drone-view geo-localization methods have high power consumption due to dense computation. SNNs offer low power consumption through spike-driven computation but haven't been thoroughly explored for DVGL, and their inherent sparsity causes information loss and difficulty learning long-range dependencies in heterogeneous visual data alignment.

Method: Proposes SpikeViMFormer with: 1) lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone for coarse-grained features, 2) spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block for selective feature enhancement, 3) spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block for long-range dependencies, 4) hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy to refine features and maintain cross-batch consistency for backbone optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs and achieves competitive performance compared with advanced ANNs while offering lower computational cost during inference.

Conclusion: SpikeViMFormer successfully demonstrates the potential of SNNs for drone-view geo-localization, achieving energy-efficient performance through innovative spike-driven components and training strategies.

Abstract: Traditional drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved remarkable performance. However, ANNs rely on dense computation, which results in high power consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which benefit from spike-driven computation, inherently provide low power consumption. Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL. In this framework, a lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone is adopted to extract coarse-grained features. To mitigate the loss of critical information, the spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block is designed, which uses a spike-driven gating mechanism to achieve selective feature enhancement and highlight discriminative regions. Furthermore, a spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block is introduced to learn long-range dependencies using a hybrid state space. Moreover, only the backbone is utilized during the inference stage to reduce computational cost. To ensure backbone effectiveness, a novel hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy is proposed. It refines features via neighborhood re-ranking and maintains cross-batch consistency to directly optimize the backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeViMFormer outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs. Compared with advanced ANNs, it also achieves competitive performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/SpikeViMFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-pathway framework (DSTED) for surgical workflow recognition that addresses temporal jitter and phase ambiguity through reliable memory propagation and uncertainty-aware prototype retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical workflow recognition methods suffer from prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases, limiting their clinical applicability for context-aware assistance and skill assessment.

Method: Proposes DSTED framework with two key components: Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) for temporal coherence by filtering/fusing high-confidence historical features, and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR) for ambiguous phase discrimination using learnable class-specific prototypes. A confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy dataset with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing second-best by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations show complementary gains: RMP contributes 2.19% and UPR 1.93%, with synergistic effects when combined.

Conclusion: The dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling temporal consistency modeling from phase ambiguity handling yields superior performance and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Purpose: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement.
  Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.
  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.
  Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.

TL;DR: MOON++ is a novel multimodal framework that uses non-contrast CT scans to assess esophageal varices severity by analyzing esophagus, liver, and spleen imaging characteristics, achieving superior performance over single-organ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Esophageal varices affect 60% of cirrhosis patients with high bleeding risk (~30%), but current diagnosis requires invasive endoscopy. Non-contrast CT offers a potential non-invasive alternative that hasn't been fully utilized clinically.

Method: MOON++ is a multimodal framework that synthesizes imaging characteristics of esophagus, liver, and spleen through multimodal learning, incorporating clinical knowledge priors about organ volumetric relationships with liver disease severity.

Result: Evaluated on 1,631 patients, validated on 239 cases, and tested on 289 cases. Achieved AUC of 0.894 vs 0.803 for severe grade classification (G3 vs <G3) and 0.921 vs 0.793 for moderate-to-severe differentiation (>=G2 vs <G2). Reader study with radiologists further validated performance.

Conclusion: MOON++ represents the first comprehensive multi-organ NCCT analysis framework for EV assessment, potentially offering a promising non-invasive diagnostic alternative to invasive endoscopy.

Abstract: Esophageal varices (EV) represent a critical complication of portal hypertension, affecting approximately 60% of cirrhosis patients with a significant bleeding risk of ~30%. While traditionally diagnosed through invasive endoscopy, non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) presents a potential non-invasive alternative that has yet to be fully utilized in clinical practice. We present Multi-Organ-COhesion Network++ (MOON++), a novel multimodal framework that enhances EV assessment through comprehensive analysis of NCCT scans. Inspired by clinical evidence correlating organ volumetric relationships with liver disease severity, MOON++ synthesizes imaging characteristics of the esophagus, liver, and spleen through multimodal learning. We evaluated our approach using 1,631 patients, those with endoscopically confirmed EV were classified into four severity grades. Validation in 239 patient cases and independent testing in 289 cases demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional single organ methods, achieving an AUC of 0.894 versus 0.803 for the severe grade EV classification (G3 versus <G3) and 0.921 versus 0.793 for the differentiation of moderate to severe grades (>=G2 versus <G2). We conducted a reader study involving experienced radiologists to further validate the performance of MOON++. To our knowledge, MOON++ represents the first comprehensive multi-organ NCCT analysis framework incorporating clinical knowledge priors for EV assessment, potentially offering a promising non-invasive diagnostic alternative.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: dMLLM-TTS is a novel framework for efficient test-time scaling of diffusion multi-modal LLMs that uses hierarchical search and self-verification to improve generation quality with 6x greater efficiency than linear search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods for diffusion multi-modal LLMs are computationally expensive (O(NT) complexity) and require external verifiers, limiting their practical deployment and full generative potential.

Method: Proposes dMLLM-TTS with two key innovations: 1) hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands/prunes sampling trajectories, and 2) self-verified feedback mechanism using dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding to assess text-image alignment without external verifiers.

Result: Extensive experiments on GenEval benchmark across three dMLLMs (Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show substantial improvement in generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

Conclusion: dMLLM-TTS effectively addresses computational efficiency and external dependency challenges in test-time scaling for diffusion multi-modal LLMs, unlocking their full generative potential through efficient trajectory exploration and self-verified refinement.

Abstract: Diffusion Multi-modal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) have recently emerged as a novel architecture unifying image generation and understanding. However, developing effective and efficient Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods to unlock their full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier. Extensive experiments on the GenEval benchmark across three representative dMLLMs (e.g., Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show that our framework substantially improves generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

*Fei Ge,Ying Huang,Jie Liu,Guixuan Zhang,Zhi Zeng,Shuwu Zhang,Hu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a collaborative deep image watermarking framework with bidirectional communication between embedder and extractor, using Adaptive Feature Modulation for content-aware feature regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods have weak coupling between embedder and extractor, lacking explicit collaboration and decoding-aware guidance during training.

Method: Introduces Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) for bidirectional communication and mutual-teacher training, plus Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) for content-aware feature regulation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in extraction accuracy on real-world and AI-generated datasets while maintaining high perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Architecture-level redesign enables robustness through coordinated representation learning rather than distortion simulation, showing strong generalization.

Abstract: Existing deep image watermarking methods follow a fixed embedding-distortion-extraction pipeline, where the embedder and extractor are weakly coupled through a final loss and optimized in isolation. This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2Pruner is a new token pruning framework for MLLMs that combines debiased importance scoring with structural pruning to handle both general understanding and fine-grained localization tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token pruning methods for MLLMs fail catastrophically on fine-grained localization tasks due to positional bias in importance-based methods and structural blindness in diversity-based methods, creating a need for a more robust pruning approach.

Method: D2Pruner first selects critical tokens as pivots using debiased attention scores, then performs Maximal Independent Set selection on remaining tokens modeled on a hybrid graph where edges represent spatial proximity and semantic similarity, iteratively preserving important and diverse tokens.

Result: D2Pruner reduces FLOPs by 74.2% while retaining 99.2% performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B for general understanding, and maintains 85.7% performance at 90% token reduction on InternVL-2.5-8B for localization tasks, with up to 63.53% improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: D2Pruner effectively addresses the limitations of existing pruning methods by combining debiased importance with structural pruning, achieving exceptional efficiency and fidelity for both general understanding and fine-grained localization tasks in MLLMs.

Abstract: Processing long visual token sequences poses a significant computational burden on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While token pruning offers a path to acceleration, we find that current methods, while adequate for general understanding, catastrophically fail on fine-grained localization tasks. We attribute this failure to the inherent flaws of the two prevailing strategies: importance-based methods suffer from a strong positional bias, an inherent model artifact that distracts from semantic content, while diversity-based methods exhibit structural blindness, disregarding the user's prompt and spatial redundancy. To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2Pruner has exceptional efficiency and fidelity. Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B for general understanding tasks, it reduces FLOPs by 74.2\% while retaining 99.2\% of its original performance. Furthermore, in challenging localization benchmarks with InternVL-2.5-8B, it maintains 85.7\% performance at a 90\% token reduction rate, marking a significant advancement with up to 63. 53\% improvement over existing methods.

Motivation: Deep learning SLR models require extensive computational resources, making them unsuitable for edge devices. Need lightweight, efficient solution for real-time deployment.

Method: Combines MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and joint coordinate extraction with parallel bidirectional reservoir computing (PBRC) architecture. PBRC uses two echo state network-based bidirectional reservoir computing modules in parallel to capture temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieved 60.85% top-1, 85.86% top-5, and 91.74% top-10 accuracy on WLASL dataset. Training time reduced to 18.67 seconds vs. 55+ minutes for Bi-GRU.

Conclusion: Proposed approach offers lightweight, cost-effective solution for real-time SLR on edge devices with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) facilitates communication between deaf and hearing communities. Deep learning based SLR models are commonly used but require extensive computational resources, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight SLR system that combines parallel bidirectional reservoir computing (PBRC) with MediaPipe. MediaPipe enables real-time hand tracking and precise extraction of hand joint coordinates, which serve as input features for the PBRC architecture. The proposed PBRC architecture consists of two echo state network (ESN) based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) modules arranged in parallel to capture temporal dependencies, thereby creating a rich feature representation for classification. We trained our PBRC-based SLR system on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies of 60.85%, 85.86%, and 91.74%, respectively. Training time was significantly reduced to 18.67 seconds due to the intrinsic properties of reservoir computing, compared to over 55 minutes for deep learning based methods such as Bi-GRU. This approach offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for real-time SLR on edge devices.

TL;DR: Emotion-Director is a cross-modal framework for emotion-oriented image generation that addresses the "affective shortcut" problem where current methods approximate emotions to semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion-oriented image generation methods suffer from an "affective shortcut" where emotions are incorrectly approximated to semantics, despite research showing emotion is not equivalent to semantics. There's a need for better emotion-oriented image generation that goes beyond semantic representation.

Method: Two-module framework: 1) MC-Diffusion - cross-modal collaborative diffusion model integrating visual prompts with textual prompts, improved with negative visual prompts in DPO optimization; 2) MC-Agent - cross-modal collaborative agent system with multi-agents simulating human subjectivity and chain-of-concept workflow for rewriting textual prompts to express intended emotions.

Result: Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of Emotion-Director in emotion-oriented image generation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Emotion-Director successfully addresses the affective shortcut problem and enables more accurate emotion-oriented image generation beyond semantic approximation through cross-modal collaboration and multi-agent prompt rewriting.

Abstract: Image generation based on diffusion models has demonstrated impressive capability, motivating exploration into diverse and specialized applications. Owing to the importance of emotion in advertising, emotion-oriented image generation has attracted increasing attention. However, current emotion-oriented methods suffer from an affective shortcut, where emotions are approximated to semantics. As evidenced by two decades of research, emotion is not equivalent to semantics. To this end, we propose Emotion-Director, a cross-modal collaboration framework consisting of two modules. First, we propose a cross-Modal Collaborative diffusion model, abbreviated as MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion integrates visual prompts with textual prompts for guidance, enabling the generation of emotion-oriented images beyond semantics. Further, we improve the DPO optimization by a negative visual prompt, enhancing the model's sensitivity to different emotions under the same semantics. Second, we propose MC-Agent, a cross-Modal Collaborative Agent system that rewrites textual prompts to express the intended emotions. To avoid template-like rewrites, MC-Agent employs multi-agents to simulate human subjectivity toward emotions, and adopts a chain-of-concept workflow that improves the visual expressiveness of the rewritten prompts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of Emotion-Director in emotion-oriented image generation.

### [148] [Dynamic Stream Network for Combinatorial Explosion Problem in Deformable Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19486)
*Shaochen Bi,Yuting He,Weiming Wang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySNet addresses combinatorial explosion in deformable medical image registration by dynamically adjusting receptive fields and weights to focus on relevant feature combinations while ignoring interfering ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the combinatorial explosion problem in Deformable Medical Image Registration (DMIR) caused by dual image inputs. When processing two images simultaneously, the number of possible feature combinations grows exponentially, leading the model to consider many interfering features during feature modeling, which hampers registration performance.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet) with two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module that dynamically adjusts the shape of receptive fields to focus on more correlated feature relationships, and 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism that generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships. These components enable the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model potential feature relationships effectively.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DySNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DMIR methods, demonstrating outstanding generalization ability across different medical image registration tasks.

Conclusion: DySNet effectively addresses the combinatorial explosion problem in DMIR by introducing dynamic receptive fields and weights, enabling the model to focus on relevant feature combinations while ignoring interfering ones, leading to superior registration performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Combinatorial explosion problem caused by dual inputs presents a critical challenge in Deformable Medical Image Registration (DMIR). Since DMIR processes two images simultaneously as input, the combination relationships between features has grown exponentially, ultimately the model considers more interfering features during the feature modeling process. Introducing dynamics in the receptive fields and weights of the network enable the model to eliminate the interfering features combination and model the potential feature combination relationships. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships. With two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module dynamically adjusts the shape of the receptive field, thereby enabling the model to focus on the feature relationships with greater correlation. 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships. Extensive experiments have shown that DySNet consistently outperforms the most advanced DMIR methods, highlighting its outstanding generalization ability.

*Georgios Voulgaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-aware deep learning framework (FusionNet) combines SWIR and TIR data with trainable signal-processing priors to model stable signatures of long-term physical processes, outperforming SOTA across spectral configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for multi-modal visual signals have inductive biases misaligned with physical signal formation processes, leading to brittle performance under cross-spectral and real-world conditions. Approaches focusing on direct thermal cues fail to capture indirect environmental alterations from sustained heat emissions.

Method: Introduces FusionNet, a physics-aware representation learning framework that integrates geological SWIR ratio (sensitive to soil property changes) with TIR data through intermediate fusion architecture. The backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors in convolutional layers, uses mixed pooling strategies, and wider receptive fields for cross-spectral robustness.

Result: DGCNN achieves 88.7% accuracy on SWIR ratio, FusionNet reaches 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments show ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting need for modality-aware training.

Conclusion: Combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust, generalizable representations. First-principles signal modeling improves multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions, demonstrating importance of aligning inductive biases with physical processes.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models operating on multi-modal visual signals often rely on inductive biases that are poorly aligned with the physical processes governing signal formation, leading to brittle performance under cross-spectral and real-world conditions. In particular, approaches that prioritise direct thermal cues struggle to capture indirect yet persistent environmental alterations induced by sustained heat emissions.
  This work introduces a physics-aware representation learning framework that leverages multi-spectral information to model stable signatures of long-term physical processes. Specifically, a geological Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) ratio sensitive to soil property changes is integrated with Thermal Infrared (TIR) data through an intermediate fusion architecture, instantiated as FusionNet. The proposed backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors within convolutional layers, combines mixed pooling strategies, and employs wider receptive fields to enhance robustness across spectral modalities.
  Systematic ablations show that each architectural component contributes to performance gains, with DGCNN achieving 88.7% accuracy on the SWIR ratio and FusionNet reaching 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments further show that ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting the importance of modality-aware training for cross-spectral learning.
  Evaluated on real-world data, the results demonstrate that combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust and generalisable representations, illustrating how first-principles signal modelling can improve multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions.

### [150] [Anatomy-R1: Enhancing Anatomy Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models via Anatomical Similarity Curriculum and Group Diversity Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19512)
*Ziyang Song,Zelin Zang,Zuyao Chen,Xusheng Liang,Dong Yi,Jinlin Wu,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel methods to improve medical reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for anatomy understanding: Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning and Group Diversity Question Augmentation, achieving significant improvements on medical VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have shown impressive progress in natural image reasoning but remain underexplored in medical imaging, especially for clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding requires precise and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult due to medical data complexity and scarcity of expert annotations. Conventional SFT strategies are limited, and while GRPO can enhance reasoning without large data, it has weaknesses in anatomy recognition: ineffective knowledge sharing between anatomical structures and premature convergence to single reasoning paths.

Method: Two novel methods: 1) Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning - a progressive learning strategy that controls question difficulty via similarity of answer choices, enabling incremental mastery of complex problems. 2) Group Diversity Question Augmentation - expands the model's search space for difficult queries by augmenting questions to mitigate uniform response tendencies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show significant improvement across both benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the limitations of GRPO in medical anatomy recognition by enabling better knowledge sharing between anatomical structures and promoting diverse reasoning strategies, leading to improved medical reasoning performance in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored, especially in clinical anatomical surgical images. Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1

*Zhuo He,Yingdong Ru,Qianying Liu,Paul Henderson,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: pbnds+ is a physics-based neural deferred shading pipeline using CNNs to reduce parameters and improve shading/relighting performance, with energy regularization for dark scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural rendering methods using MLPs have too many parameters requiring high computation, complicating training and reducing performance. Data-driven approaches need large datasets and can be biased by unbalanced data (e.g., ignoring dark scenes).

Method: Introduces pbnds+: a physics-based neural deferred shading pipeline using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to decrease parameters and improve performance. Also proposes energy regularization to restrict model reflection during dark illumination.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms classical baselines, a state-of-the-art neural shading model, and a diffusion-based method.

Conclusion: pbnds+ effectively addresses parameter efficiency and dark scene bias in neural rendering, achieving superior performance in shading and relighting tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering have achieved impressive results on photorealistic shading and relighting, by using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a regression model to learn the rendering equation from a real-world dataset. Such methods show promise for photorealistically relighting real-world objects, which is difficult to classical rendering, as there is no easy-obtained material ground truth. However, significant challenges still remain the dense connections in MLPs result in a large number of parameters, which requires high computation resources, complicating the training, and reducing performance during rendering. Data driven approaches require large amounts of training data for generalization; unbalanced data might bias the model to ignore the unusual illumination conditions, e.g. dark scenes. This paper introduces pbnds+: a novel physics-based neural deferred shading pipeline utilizing convolution neural networks to decrease the parameters and improve the performance in shading and relighting tasks; Energy regularization is also proposed to restrict the model reflection during dark illumination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms classical baselines, a state-of-the-art neural shading model, and a diffusion-based method.

*Marc Peral,Guillem Capellera,Luis Ferraz,Antonio Rubio,Antonio Agudo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal transformer architecture for soccer scene analysis from tactical camera footage, handling ball trajectory inference, ball state classification, and ball possessor identification without direct ball tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on accurate ball tracking or handcrafted heuristics, which fail under noisy or occluded conditions in real soccer matches. There's a need for robust analysis without direct access to ball positions.

Method: Integrates three modalities (player trajectories, player types, player image crops) using sociotemporal transformer blocks. Introduces CropDrop pre-training strategy to prevent over-reliance on image features and encourage cross-modal learning.

Result: Substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on all three tasks (ball trajectory inference, ball state classification, ball possessor identification) on large-scale dataset from real top league matches.

Conclusion: Combining structured and visual cues in transformer architecture with realistic masking strategies (CropDrop) enables robust multi-modal soccer scene analysis without direct ball tracking, handling noisy/occluded conditions effectively.

Abstract: In this work we propose a multi-modal architecture for analyzing soccer scenes from tactical camera footage, with a focus on three core tasks: ball trajectory inference, ball state classification, and ball possessor identification. To this end, our solution integrates three distinct input modalities (player trajectories, player types and image crops of individual players) into a unified framework that processes spatial and temporal dynamics using a cascade of sociotemporal transformer blocks. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on accurate ball tracking or handcrafted heuristics, our approach infers the ball trajectory without direct access to its past or future positions, and robustly identifies the ball state and ball possessor under noisy or occluded conditions from real top league matches. We also introduce CropDrop, a modality-specific masking pre-training strategy that prevents over-reliance on image features and encourages the model to rely on cross-modal patterns during pre-training. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale dataset providing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in all tasks. Our results highlight the benefits of combining structured and visual cues in a transformer-based architecture, and the importance of realistic masking strategies in multi-modal learning.

Abstract: Poor adaptation of orbital implants remains a major contributor to postoperative complications and revision surgery. Although preformed orbital plates are widely used to reduce cost and operative time compared with customized implants, surgeons currently lack publicly available tools and standardized metrics to quantitatively compare plate fit across vendors, sizes, and patient anatomy. We developed SlicerOrbitSurgerySim, an open-source extension for the 3D Slicer platform that enables interactive virtual registration, evaluation, and comparison of multiple preformed orbital plates in a patient-specific virtual planning environment. The software generates reproducible quantitative plate-to-orbit distance metrics and visualization tools that support both patient-specific planning and population-level statistical analysis of plate adaptability. By facilitating objective comparison of implant designs and placement strategies, this tool aims to improve preoperative decision-making, reduce intraoperative plate modification, and promote collaborative research and surgical education. Pilot studies, sample datasets, and detailed tutorials are provided to support testing, transparency, and reproducibility.

*Moritz Böhle,Amélie Royer,Juliette Marrie,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASA (Cross-Attention via Self-Attention) improves vision-language models by enabling local text-to-text interaction in cross-attention layers, reducing performance gap with full token insertion while maintaining efficiency for long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs face efficiency issues with high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos when using full token insertion, while cross-attention models are more efficient but suffer performance gaps, especially on fine-grained visual detail tasks.

Method: Proposes CASA paradigm that enables local text-to-text interaction within dedicated cross-attention layers, combining cross-attention efficiency with improved text interaction capabilities.

Result: Substantially reduces the performance gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks while maintaining the same scalability as cross-attention models for long-context multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: CASA provides a simple and efficient solution that bridges the performance-efficiency trade-off in VLMs, making it suitable for both detailed image understanding and scalable long-context applications like streaming video captioning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are commonly trained by inserting image tokens from a pretrained vision encoder into the textual stream of a language model. This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

TL;DR: StoryMem transforms single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers using visual memory banks and novel memory injection techniques, achieving superior cross-shot consistency for long-form video storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling requires generating multi-shot videos with cinematic quality and long-range consistency, which current single-shot video diffusion models struggle with. The paper aims to enable coherent minute-long video storytelling by addressing cross-shot consistency challenges.

Method: Proposes StoryMem paradigm with Memory-to-Video (M2V) design: maintains dynamic memory bank of historical keyframes, injects memory via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with LoRA fine-tuning, uses semantic keyframe selection and aesthetic filtering for stable memory.

Result: StoryMem achieves superior cross-shot consistency over previous methods while preserving high aesthetic quality and prompt adherence, enabling coherent minute-long video storytelling. Also introduces ST-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: StoryMem marks a significant step toward coherent long-form video storytelling by transforming single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers through explicit visual memory conditioning, with applications for smooth shot transitions and customized story generation.

Abstract: Visual storytelling requires generating multi-shot videos with cinematic quality and long-range consistency. Inspired by human memory, we propose StoryMem, a paradigm that reformulates long-form video storytelling as iterative shot synthesis conditioned on explicit visual memory, transforming pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers. This is achieved by a novel Memory-to-Video (M2V) design, which maintains a compact and dynamically updated memory bank of keyframes from historical generated shots. The stored memory is then injected into single-shot video diffusion models via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with only LoRA fine-tuning. A semantic keyframe selection strategy, together with aesthetic preference filtering, further ensures informative and stable memory throughout generation. Moreover, the proposed framework naturally accommodates smooth shot transitions and customized story generation applications. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce ST-Bench, a diverse benchmark for multi-shot video storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StoryMem achieves superior cross-shot consistency over previous methods while preserving high aesthetic quality and prompt adherence, marking a significant step toward coherent minute-long video storytelling.

TL;DR: ActAvatar is a talking avatar framework that achieves precise phase-level action control through textual guidance, addressing challenges in text-following capability, temporal alignment, and dependency on additional control signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking avatar methods have insufficient text-following capability for diverse actions, lack temporal alignment between actions and audio content, and depend on additional control signals like pose skeletons.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA) decomposes prompts into global base and temporally-anchored phase blocks for precise temporal-semantic alignment; 2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment aligns modality influence with hierarchical feature learning; 3) Two-stage training strategy establishes audio-visual correspondence first, then injects action control through fine-tuning.

Result: ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality according to extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ActAvatar successfully addresses key challenges in talking avatar generation by achieving phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance while maintaining audio-visual alignment.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in talking avatar generation, existing methods face critical challenges: insufficient text-following capability for diverse actions, lack of temporal alignment between actions and audio content, and dependency on additional control signals such as pose skeletons. We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActAvatar significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both action control and visual quality.

TL;DR: BabyFlow is a generative AI model that disentangles facial identity and expression in infant faces using normalizing flows, enabling independent control and improved 3D reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of developmental disorders can be aided by analyzing infant craniofacial morphology, but modeling infant faces is challenging due to limited data and frequent spontaneous expressions.

Method: Uses normalizing flows to learn flexible, probabilistic representations of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. Performs cross-age expression transfer from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic expressive variants.

Result: Improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions (mouth, eyes, nose), supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity, and integrates with diffusion models to generate high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry.

Conclusion: BabyFlow provides powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis, addressing challenges in infant facial modeling through disentangled identity-expression representation and cross-age expression transfer.

Abstract: Early detection of developmental disorders can be aided by analyzing infant craniofacial morphology, but modeling infant faces is challenging due to limited data and frequent spontaneous expressions. We introduce BabyFlow, a generative AI model that disentangles facial identity and expression, enabling independent control over both. Using normalizing flows, BabyFlow learns flexible, probabilistic representations that capture the complex, non-linear variability of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis.

*Marta Hasny,Laura Daza,Keno Bressem,Maxime Di Folco,Julia Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoVTL is a robust vision-tabular learning framework that handles any level of tabular data availability (0-100%) through contrastive pretraining with missingness augmentation and gated cross-attention fusion with novel ranking loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets often have incomplete tabular data, but existing methods assume full availability during both training and inference. There's a need for methods that can leverage all tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Contrastive pretraining with tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation, 2) Downstream task tuning using gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion with Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on available tabular data, combined with disentangled gradient learning.

Result: Superior robustness to missing tabular data on UK Biobank cardiac MRI scans compared to prior methods. Successfully generalizes to external cardiac MRI dataset for disease classification and extends to natural images domain (car advertisements dataset).

Conclusion: RoVTL provides an effective solution for handling variable tabular data completeness in multimodal learning, demonstrating robustness across medical imaging and natural image domains with practical applicability to real-world incomplete datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale medical biobanks provide imaging data complemented by extensive tabular information, such as demographics or clinical measurements. However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

*Artemis Panagopoulou,Aveek Purohit,Achin Kulshrestha,Soroosh Yazdani,Mohit Goyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning like map route tracing. The paper introduces a synthetic data pipeline to generate precise path annotations, creates a 23k-sample dataset, and shows fine-tuning improves spatial reasoning performance on MapBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding, particularly for tasks like route tracing on maps. Unlike humans who can quickly learn map navigation, models fail to respect path constraints due to the difficulty and cost of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations.

Method: The authors introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that uses synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise path annotations. They construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23,000 path samples across 4,000 maps. This dataset is then used to fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs.

Result: Results on MapBench show substantial improvements: fine-tuning raises success rates by up to 6.4 points and reduces path-tracing error (NDTW). The gains demonstrate that fine-grained spatial reasoning, which is absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught through synthetic supervision.

Conclusion: Fine-grained spatial reasoning capabilities can be effectively taught to MLLMs using synthetic supervision. The synthetic data generation pipeline provides a scalable solution to overcome the annotation bottleneck for spatial understanding tasks, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved human-like performance on many visual and textual reasoning tasks, their proficiency in fine-grained spatial understanding, such as route tracing on maps remains limited. Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision.

TL;DR: This paper presents a diffusion-based generative modeling framework for agricultural AI that addresses data scarcity through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural AI requires large, diverse, high-quality plant image datasets, but collecting such data in real field conditions is costly, labor-intensive, and seasonally constrained.

Method: Three main approaches: 1) Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion on captioned indoor/outdoor plant imagery for text-conditioned image generation, 2) Using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image-guided diffusion for indoor-to-outdoor translation, 3) Preference-guided fine-tuning with expert scores and reward-weighted updates.

Result: Synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve phenotype classification accuracy; translated images enhance weed detection/classification with YOLOv8; preference-guided fine-tuning produces more stable and expert-aligned outputs.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward data-efficient generative pipelines for agricultural AI, addressing key challenges in plant image data collection and quality.

Abstract: The success of agricultural artificial intelligence depends heavily on large, diverse, and high-quality plant image datasets, yet collecting such data in real field conditions is costly, labor intensive, and seasonally constrained. This paper investigates diffusion-based generative modeling to address these challenges through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference aligned fine tuning. First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdoor plant imagery to generate realistic, text conditioned images of canola and soybean. Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8. Finally, a preference guided fine tuning framework trains a reward model on expert scores and applies reward weighted updates to produce more stable and expert aligned outputs.

*Arnold Caleb Asiimwe,Carl Vondrick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoGS reinterprets 4D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous-time dynamical system where scene motion emerges from integrating a learned neural dynamical field, enabling sample-efficient learning, temporal extrapolation, and compositional dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deformation-based approaches for dynamic scene representation lack motion coherence, temporal consistency, and the ability to extrapolate beyond observed time ranges. The paper aims to model scene motion as a continuous physical system rather than applying per-frame deformations.

Method: EvoGS treats Gaussian representation as an evolving physical system whose state evolves continuously under a learned neural dynamical field. This continuous-time formulation integrates learned motion laws rather than applying per-frame deformations.

Result: Experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show EvoGS achieves better motion coherence and temporal consistency compared to deformation-field baselines while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: The continuous-time dynamical system formulation enables sample-efficient learning from sparse supervision, temporal extrapolation beyond observed ranges, and compositional dynamics for controllable scene synthesis, outperforming deformation-based approaches.

Abstract: We reinterpret 4D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous-time dynamical system, where scene motion arises from integrating a learned neural dynamical field rather than applying per-frame deformations. This formulation, which we call EvoGS, treats the Gaussian representation as an evolving physical system whose state evolves continuously under a learned motion law. This unlocks capabilities absent in deformation-based approaches:(1) sample-efficient learning from sparse temporal supervision by modeling the underlying motion law; (2) temporal extrapolation enabling forward and backward prediction beyond observed time ranges; and (3) compositional dynamics that allow localized dynamics injection for controllable scene synthesis. Experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show that EvoGS achieves better motion coherence and temporal consistency compared to deformation-field baselines while maintaining real-time rendering

*Luchao Qi,Jiaye Wu,Jun Myeong Choi,Cary Phillips,Roni Sengupta,Dan B Goldman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Over++ is a video effect generation framework that synthesizes realistic environmental interactions (shadows, reflections, dust, splashes) between foreground and background layers while preserving the original video content, addressing the limitations of existing video generative models and inpainting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current professional video compositing requires manual creation of environmental interactions, while existing video generative models fail to preserve input videos and video inpainting methods either need costly per-frame masks or produce implausible results.

Method: Over++ is a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. It uses a paired effect dataset with unpaired augmentation strategy for text-driven editability, and supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without dense annotations.

Result: Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the augmented compositing task and presents Over++ as an effective solution for generating realistic environmental interactions in video compositing while preserving original scene content, offering practical advantages over current methods.

Abstract: In professional video compositing workflows, artists must manually create environmental interactions-such as shadows, reflections, dust, and splashes-between foreground subjects and background layers. Existing video generative models struggle to preserve the input video while adding such effects, and current video inpainting methods either require costly per-frame masks or yield implausible results. We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations. Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation.

*Argha Kamal Samanta,Harshika Goyal,Vasudha Joshi,Tushar Mungle,Pabitra Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel multimodal framework integrates retinal images, clinical text, and structured patient data for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, achieving near-perfect cross-modal retrieval and state-of-the-art classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain vision-language models like CLIP perform poorly in medical applications, particularly for cross-modal retrieval of ophthalmological images, creating a critical gap in medical image-text alignment that needs to be addressed.

Method: Knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework using separate encoders (ViT-B/16 for images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for text, MLP for structured data) fused through multimodal transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained with contrastive losses, reconstruction losses, and classification losses for DR severity grading.

Result: Achieves 99.94% Recall@1 for text-to-image retrieval vs. fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, maintains 97.05% classification accuracy for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR, and shows strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 on unseen dataset vs. 0.22% for CLIP.

Conclusion: The multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in medical domain, establishing superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance for diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.

*Mojtaba Safari,Shansong Wang,Vanessa L Wildman,Mingzhe Hu,Zach Eidex,Chih-Wei Chang,Erik H Middlebrooks,Richard L. J Qiu,Pretesh Patel,Ashesh B. Jania,Hui Mao,Zhen Tian,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel MRI super-resolution framework combining multi-head selective state-space models with lightweight channel MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance with exceptional computational efficiency (0.9M parameters, 57 GFLOPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution MRI is clinically important but limited by long acquisition times. Existing deep learning super-resolution methods face trade-offs between fidelity and computational efficiency, hindering clinical integration.

Method: Proposed framework combines multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with lightweight channel MLP. Uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI super-resolution solution with enhanced anatomical detail. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation.

Abstract: Background: High-resolution MRI is critical for diagnosis, but long acquisition times limit clinical use. Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001).

The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation.

### [165] [WorldWarp: Propagating 3D Geometry with Asynchronous Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19678)
*Hanyang Kong,Xingyi Yang,Xiaoxu Zheng,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldWarp: A framework combining 3D geometric cache with 2D generative refinement for geometrically consistent long-range video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods struggle with geometric consistency because they operate in camera-conditioned latent spaces rather than respecting 3D geometry in pixel space, leading to problems with occlusions and complex camera trajectories.

Method: WorldWarp couples a 3D structural anchor (Gaussian Splatting-based geometric cache) with a 2D generative refiner (Spatio-Temporal Diffusion model). The 3D cache warps historical content into novel views as structural scaffold, while the ST-Diff model uses a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule for "fill-and-revise" - blank regions get full noise for generation, warped regions get partial noise for refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture, maintaining consistency across video chunks through dynamic 3D cache updates.

Conclusion: WorldWarp successfully bridges the gap between geometric consistency requirements and generative model effectiveness by combining explicit 3D warping with adaptive generative refinement, solving occlusion and complex trajectory problems in long-range video generation.

Abstract: Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

### [166] [VA-$π$: Variational Policy Alignment for Pixel-Aware Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19680)
*Xinyao Liao,Qiyuan He,Kai Xu,Xiaoye Qu,Yicong Li,Wei Wei,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VA-π is a lightweight post-training framework that aligns autoregressive visual generators with tokenizers by optimizing them directly with pixel-space objectives through variational optimization and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a misalignment between tokenizers (trained for image reconstruction) and AR generators (optimized only for token likelihood), leading to generated token sequences that decode into low-quality images without direct pixel-space supervision.

Method: VA-π formulates generator-tokenizer alignment as variational optimization, deriving an ELBO that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. It uses a reinforcement-based alignment strategy treating the AR generator as a policy, with pixel-space reconstruction quality as intrinsic reward measured under teacher forcing.

Result: With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, VA-π reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL. It also improves text-to-image performance on GenEval for both visual generation (LlamaGen: 0.306→0.339) and unified multi-modal models (Janus-Pro: 0.725→0.744).

Conclusion: VA-π enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators without tokenizer retraining or external reward models, providing direct pixel-level guidance while maintaining distributional consistency of tokens through ELBO regularization.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generation relies on tokenizers to map images to and from discrete sequences. However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$π$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$π$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$π$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$π$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models. With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, it reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL, while also yielding notable gains in the text-to-image task on GenEval for both visual generation model (LlamaGen: from 0.306 to 0.339) and unified multi-modal model (Janus-Pro: from 0.725 to 0.744).

### [167] [From Indoor to Open World: Revealing the Spatial Reasoning Gap in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19683)
*Mingrui Wu,Zhaozhi Wang,Fangjinhua Wang,Jiaolong Yang,Marc Pollefeys,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs lack spatial intelligence, so authors create a benchmark with outdoor pedestrian-view videos (stereo+LiDAR+IMU/GPS) to generate metric 3D spatial reasoning questions, revealing MLLMs rely on linguistic priors not visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have underdeveloped spatial intelligence crucial for robust AI, and existing benchmarks are inadequate - either too simple (qualitative) or domain-specific (indoor), lacking outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth.

Method: Created large-scale benchmark from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors, providing metrically precise 3D information to automatically generate hierarchical spatial reasoning questions.

Result: Performance gains from structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings; synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirm current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors rather than grounded visual reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a principled platform for diagnosing MLLM limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence beyond current linguistic-prior dependency.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance on semantic tasks, their spatial intelligence--crucial for robust and grounded AI systems--remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore scene context and operate in hand-centric coordinates, which hinders metric accuracy and practical use for reconstructing object manipulation from videos.

Method: 1) Use data-driven foundation models to initialize object mesh/poses, scene point cloud, and hand poses. 2) Apply two-stage optimization to recover complete hand-object motion from grasping to interaction that remains consistent with observed scene information.

Result: First system capable of reconstructing in-scene object manipulation from monocular RGB video with metric accuracy and physically plausible interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses challenges of ill-posed scene reconstruction, ambiguous hand-object depth, and need for physically plausible interactions by incorporating scene context and using foundation models with optimization.

Abstract: We build the first system to address the problem of reconstructing in-scene object manipulation from a monocular RGB video. It is challenging due to ill-posed scene reconstruction, ambiguous hand-object depth, and the need for physically plausible interactions. Existing methods operate in hand centric coordinates and ignore the scene, hindering metric accuracy and practical use. In our method, we first use data-driven foundation models to initialize the core components, including the object mesh and poses, the scene point cloud, and the hand poses. We then apply a two-stage optimization that recovers a complete hand-object motion from grasping to interaction, which remains consistent with the scene information observed in the input video.

*Zixuan Ye,Quande Liu,Cong Wei,Yuanxing Zhang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Wenhan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve visual context consistency in multimodal generation by integrating visual planning and iterative correction into Chain-of-Thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought approaches focus on text consistency but ignore visual context consistency with reference images, leading to failures in maintaining key visual features like human ID, object attributes, and style in multimodal generation tasks.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Adaptive Visual Planning generates structured visual checklists to identify visual elements needing consistency; 2) Iterative Visual Correction performs self-reflection guided by checklists and refines results iteratively. Uses supervised fine-tuning to teach planning, reflection, and refinement, plus flow-GRPO with customized visual checking reward.

Result: The method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text-only Chain-of-Thought approaches in multimodal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency.

Conclusion: Integrating visual context consistency into reasoning through visual planning and iterative correction significantly improves multimodal generation quality by maintaining key visual features from reference images.

Abstract: Recently, the introduction of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has largely improved the generation ability of unified models. However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward. The experiments show that our method outperforms both zero-shot unified models and those with text CoTs in multi-modal generation, demonstrating higher visual context consistency.

TL;DR: Interact2Ar is the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body human-human interactions with detailed hand motions and adaptive coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for generating human-human interactions have limitations: they ignore hand motions (reducing realism) and generate entire sequences simultaneously (limiting ability to capture reactive, adaptive nature of interactions). There's a need for more realistic, expressive, and adaptive interaction generation.

Method: Interact2Ar uses an autoregressive diffusion model with parallel branches for detailed hand kinematics. It features an autoregressive pipeline with novel memory technique for efficient large context windows, enabling adaptation to interaction variability. The model is text-conditioned and end-to-end.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating full-body human-human interactions. It enables downstream applications like temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension to multi-person scenarios. New robust evaluators and extended metrics validate the generated motions.

Conclusion: Interact2Ar successfully addresses previous limitations by generating realistic, expressive full-body interactions with hand motions through an adaptive autoregressive approach, opening up new applications in human interaction generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic human-human interactions is a challenging task that requires not only high-quality individual body and hand motions, but also coherent coordination among all interactants. Due to limitations in available data and increased learning complexity, previous methods tend to ignore hand motions, limiting the realism and expressivity of the interactions. Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation. Furthermore, we introduce an autoregressive pipeline coupled with a novel memory technique that facilitates adaptation to the inherent variability of human interactions using efficient large context windows. The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios. To validate the generated motions, we introduce a set of robust evaluators and extended metrics designed specifically for assessing full-body interactions. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Interact2Ar.

*Weichen Fan,Haiwen Diao,Quan Wang,Dahua Lin,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Prism Hypothesis - semantic encoders capture low-frequency components for abstract meaning while pixel encoders retain high-frequency details, and proposes Unified Autoencoding (UAE) to harmonize both via frequency-band modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the spectral characteristics of different encoders and establish a unifying perspective that connects encoder behavior to underlying spectral structure, revealing that semantic and pixel encoders operate on different frequency bands.

Method: Systematic analysis of spectral characteristics of semantic and pixel encoders, formulation of the Prism Hypothesis, and development of Unified Autoencoding (UAE) with a frequency-band modulator to harmonize semantic structure and pixel details.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks show that UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The Prism Hypothesis provides a unifying perspective on encoder behavior, and UAE successfully demonstrates how to harmonize semantic and pixel information through frequency-band modulation, achieving strong performance on major benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep representations across modalities are inherently intertwined. In this paper, we systematically analyze the spectral characteristics of various semantic and pixel encoders. Interestingly, our study uncovers a highly inspiring and rarely explored correspondence between an encoder's feature spectrum and its functional role: semantic encoders primarily capture low-frequency components that encode abstract meaning, whereas pixel encoders additionally retain high-frequency information that conveys fine-grained detail. This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance.
